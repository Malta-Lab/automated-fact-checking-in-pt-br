Rather than making Beth redundant, the company puts Beth on the Job Support Scheme, working 2 days a week (40% of her usual hours).\nHer employer pays Beth £140 for the days she works.\nAnd for the time she is not working (3 days or 60%, worth £210), she will also earn2/3, or £140, bringing her total earnings to £280, 80% of her normal wage.\nThe Government will give a grant worth £70 (1/3 of hours not worked, equivalent to 20% of her normal wages) to Beth’s employer to support them in keeping Beth’s job."

The Government will then pay a third of the hours not worked (up to a cap), with the employer also contributing a third. The remaining unpaid third is effectively the employee’s contribution to the scheme. This means that an employee earns 77% of their normal wage where the Government contribution has not been capped."

            "answer": "The majority of deaths during the influenza pandemic of 1918-1919 were not caused by the influenza virus acting alone, report researchers from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health. Instead, most victims succumbed to bacterial pneumonia following influenza virus infection. The pneumonia was caused when bacteria that normally inhabit the nose and throat invaded the lungs along a pathway created when the virus destroyed the cells that line the bronchial tubes and lungs.\n\nA future influenza pandemic may unfold in a similar manner, say the NIAID authors, whose paper in the Oct. 1 issue of The Journal of Infectious Diseases is now available online. Therefore, the authors conclude, comprehensive pandemic preparations should include not only efforts to produce new or improved influenza vaccines and antiviral drugs but also provisions to stockpile antibiotics and bacterial vaccines as well.\n\nThe work presents complementary lines of evidence from the fields of pathology and history of medicine to support this conclusion. \"The weight of evidence we examined from both historical and modern analyses of the 1918 influenza pandemic favors a scenario in which viral damage followed by bacterial pneumonia led to the vast majority of deaths,\" says co-author NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D. \"In essence, the virus landed the first blow while bacteria delivered the knockout punch.\"\n\nNIAID co-author and pathologist Jeffery Taubenberger, M.D., Ph.D., examined lung tissue samples from 58 soldiers who died of influenza at various U. S. military bases in 1918 and 1919. The samples, preserved in paraffin blocks, were re-cut and stained to allow microscopic evaluation. Examination revealed a spectrum of tissue damage \"ranging from changes characteristic of the primary viral pneumonia and evidence of tissue repair to evidence of severe, acute, secondary bacterial pneumonia,\" says Dr. Taubenberger. In most cases, he adds"

Although a nasty strain of flu virus swept around the world, bacterial pneumonia that came on the heels of mostly mild cases of flu killed the majority of the 20 to 100 million victims of the so-called Spanish flu, they conclude.\n\n“We agree completely that bacterial pneumonia played a major role in the mortality of the 1918 pandemic,” says Anthony Fauci, director of National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Disease in Bethesda, Maryland, and author of another journal article out next month that comes to a similar conclusion."

            "answer": "As of October 15, 216,025 deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported in the United States*; however, this number might underestimate the total impact of the pandemic on mortality. Measures of excess deaths have been used to estimate the impact of public health pandemics or disasters, particularly when there are questions about underascertainment of deaths directly attributable to a given event or cause (1–6).† Excess deaths are defined as the number of persons who have died from all causes, in excess of the expected number of deaths for a given place and time. This report describes trends and demographic patterns in excess deaths during January 26–October 3, 2020. Expected numbers of deaths were estimated using overdispersed Poisson regression models with spline terms to account for seasonal patterns, using provisional mortality data from CDC’s National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) (7). Weekly numbers of deaths by age group and race/ethnicity were assessed to examine the difference between the weekly number of deaths occurring in 2020 and the average number occurring in the same week during 2015–2019 and the percentage change in 2020. Overall, an estimated 299,028 excess deaths have occurred in the United States from late January through October 3, 2020, with two thirds of these attributed to COVID-19. The largest percentage increases were seen among adults aged 25–44 years and among Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) persons. These results provide information about the degree to which COVID-19 deaths might be underascertained and inform efforts to prevent mortality directly or indirectly associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, such as efforts to minimize disruptions to health care.\n\nEstimates of excess deaths can provide a comprehensive account of mortality related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including deaths that are directly or indirectly attributable to COVID-19. Estimates of the numbers of deaths directly attributable to COVID-19 might be limi"

          {
            "answer": "Based on NVSS data, excess deaths have occurred every week in the United States since March 2020. An estimated 299,028 more persons than expected have died since January 26, 2020; approximately two thirds of these deaths were attributed to COVID-19. A recent analysis of excess deaths from March through July reported very similar findings, but that study did not include more recent data through September (5).\n\nAlthough more excess deaths have occurred among older age groups, relative to past years, adults aged 25–44 years have experienced the largest average percentage increase in the number of deaths from all causes from late January through October 3, 2020. The age distribution of COVID-19 deaths shifted toward younger age groups from May through August (9); however, these disproportionate increases might also be related to underlying trends in other causes of death. Future analyses might shed light on the extent to which increases among younger age groups are driven by COVID-19 or by other causes of death. Among racial and ethnic groups, the smallest average percentage increase in numbers of deaths compared with previous years occurred among White persons (11.9%) and the largest for Hispanic persons (53.6%), with intermediate increases (28.9%–36.6%) among AI/AN, Black, and Asian persons. These disproportionate increases among certain racial and ethnic groups are consistent with noted disparities in COVID-19 mortality.***\n\nThe findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, the weighting of provisional NVSS mortality data might not fully account for reporting lags, particularly in recent weeks. Estimated numbers of deaths in the most recent weeks are likely underestimated and will increase as more data become available. Second, there is uncertainty associated with the models used to generate the expected numbers of deaths in a given week. A range of values for excess death estimates is provided elsewhere (7), but these ranges might not refl"

Kahn. An excerpt is posted to the website for the President Lincoln's Cottage museum.\n\nLincoln was also willing to consider \"expressions of public opinion from the country” about the future nominee, according to historian Michael Burlingame, as reported in The Washington Post.\n\nBut of Harris' claim that Lincoln delayed the nomination to give Americans a say in the decision, Burlingame told PolitiFact, \"I've never seen anything like that quote in all my 36 years of Lincoln research.\"\n\nCandidates vying for Taney's position included ambitious climbers on both sides of the political aisle. Rather than alienate potential supporters, Lincoln used the Supreme Court vacancy as political leverage during his campaign, Kahn wrote. Influential politicians, such as former Treasury secretary, presidential candidate and rival Salmon P. Chase campaigned for Lincoln.\n\nThough he won reelection, Lincoln  did not put forth a nomination to replace Taney until lawmakers returned to Washington."

            "answer": "Even if a person is wearing an airtight medical grade mask, like an N95 or FFP2 mask, the risks of lethargy, headache, and dizziness are low, even after wearing one for several hours. For an average healthy person wearing a cloth or surgical mask, there is even less risk of these symptoms occurring, because they still allow oxygen to flow out of the mouth and nose freely.\n\nWhile it might feel like breathing is more difficult in a mask and you are not getting enough air, that is likely a response to stress or anxiety from wearing the mask and can usually be helped by focusing on normal breathing patterns. Shallow breathing, hyperventilation, and breath holding can cause increases in carbon dioxide which leads to headaches and nausea. These symptoms are generally not caused by the use of masks."

            "answer": "Doctors typically refer to two distinct forms of oxygen deprivation: anoxic brain injuries occur when the brain is totally deprived of oxygen due to sudden cardiac arrest, choking, strangulation, and other sudden injuries. Hypoxic brain injuries occur when the brain receives less oxygen than it needs, but is not completely deprived of oxygen. Because the effects of the two injuries are similar, many brain experts use the terms interchangeably.\n\nA few seconds of oxygen deprivation won't cause lasting harm, so a child who holds his breath in frustration, a combatant choked unconscious during a Jiu-Jitsu match, and a diver who needs a few extra seconds to come up for air are unlikely to experience brain damage. The precise timeline of anoxic brain injuries depends on a number of personal idiosyncrasies, including overall brain and cardiovascular health, as well as the level of blood oxygenation at the time of injury. Generally speaking, injuries begin at the one-minute mark, steadily worsening thereafter.\nHow Long Can the Brain Go Without Oxygen? A Timeline\n\n    Between 30-180 seconds of oxygen deprivation, you may lose consciousness.\n    At the one-minute mark, brain cells begin dying.\n    At three minutes, neurons suffer more extensive damage, and lasting brain damage becomes more likely.\n    At five minutes, death becomes imminent.\n    At 10 minutes, even if the brain remains alive, a coma and lasting brain damage are almost inevitable.\n    At 15 minutes, survival becomes nearly impossible.\n\nThere are, of course, exceptions to every rule. Some training routines help the body make more efficient use of oxygen, enabling the brain to go longer periods without this vital element. Free divers routinely train to go long periods without oxygen, and the current record holder, Aleix Segura held his breath for 24 minutes and 3 seconds without sustaining brain damage!"

Since his election in March 2015, Buhari has been able to curb the influence of the Islamist extremists. But although the president in December 2015 said that Boko Haram was \"technically defeated,\" the islamists continue to attack. The terrorist group is said to be responsible for an attack in Maiduguri on Wednesday that left eight people dead.\n\nStill unclear is under what circumstances the 21 Chibok schoolgirls were released on Thursday. According to local sources, the girls were swapped for Boko Haram prisoners. The Nigerian government has denied this. Over two years ago, Boko Haram kidnapped 276 Nigerian schoolgirls from Chibok. The Chibok girls became a symbol of the Boko Haram terror. Although the Nigerian military was able to claw back territory from from Boko Haram, Buhari has been under criticism, because he wasn't - until this week - able to free any of the girls.\n\nAnd in the northeastern part of the country, the population still faces a humanitarian crisis because of Boko Haram. UNICEF workers are referring to the worst situation of hunger in the world. More than three million people in the region have been forced out of their homes. Aid agencies can only reach many of the refugee camps by helicopter - the streets are very insecure. Oxfam workers accuse the army of doing nothing in the region instead of securing access roads for aid agencies. 2. Economic slump\n\nThe fight against Boko Haram is costing Buhari a lot of money and it is running out. The price of oil has gone down by half since mid 2014, likewise oil production has sunk drastically due to sabotage by rebels in the Niger Delta - Buhari's next problem.

The signature can then be compared with the voter’s signature on file, usually from a voter registration form.\n\nEight states also require a witness signature, while three states require notarization, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL). Alabama has perhaps the strictest rules, directing voters to submit copies of their IDs as well as signatures from either a notary or two witnesses.\n\nThe return envelopes are typically opened by a different group of workers from those who scan the ballots. Outside observers, often appointed by a political party or campaign, are allowed to monitor post-election procedures, such as ballot counting. All but four states - North Carolina, Kansas, Maine and Florida - explicitly permit partisan observers to watch some post-election processes, according to the NCSL.\n\nIn addition, ballots vary widely in appearance - not just from state to state but also from county to county and even from town to town, because most voters are not just making a choice for U.S. president but also for local offices. Any ballot that does not match the proper form will be rejected by election officials.\n\nMany jurisdictions use bar codes on ballot envelopes that can be used to help with ballot processing, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University, a public policy institute. The bar codes also allow voters to track their ballots to ensure they have been received."

What we eat and drink can affect our body’s ability to prevent, fight and recover from infections.\n\nWhile no foods or dietary supplements can prevent or cure COVID-19 infection, healthy diets are important for supporting immune systems. Good nutrition can also reduce the likelihood of developing other health problems, including obesity, heart disease, diabetes and some types of cancer.\n\nFor babies, a healthy diet means exclusive breastfeeding in the first six months, with the introduction of nutritious and safe foods to complement breastmilk from age 6 months to 2 years and beyond. For young children, a healthy and balanced diet is essential for growth and development. For older people, it can help to ensure healthier and more active lives."

Phil Murphy on Friday signed an executive order for the Nov. 3 elections to be conducted in a hybrid but mostly mail-in fashion in the Garden State amid the coronavirus pandemic. All of the state’s active registered voters will automatically receive ballots in the mail, though there will still be some in-person polling locations across the state where people can cast a paper provisional ballot.\n\nMurphy said you can put your ballot in the mail, drop it in one of several secure boxes to be set up across the state, bring it to polling location on Election Day, or vote provisionally in person.\n\nThis comes despite extreme opposition to widespread mail-in voting from President Donald Trump, as well as from other Republicans and some county officials in New Jersey, who warn about the potential for voter fraud."

Also, about 1 in 10 people who mailed in ballots in May’s special elections had their votes rejected.\n\nAnd there were allegations of voter fraud in the Paterson City Council race in May. State Attorney General Gurbir Grewal filed voting fraud charges against a city councilman and a councilman-elect.\n\nGov. Phil Murphy said Friday that this is actually “positive” because “law enforcement is all over it.\" - “If you screw around, you will be caught and be held accountable,” he said."

A total of 24 states now allow mail-in voting for any reason including fear of the coronavirus, compared with 16 in 2016. The number of states mailing ballots to all registered voters has also doubled, going from five in 2016 to 10 this year. The New York Times has reported that ballot request data indicates that more Democrats than Republicans are likely to vote by mail in 2020.\n\n“It would be very difficult to orchestrate some kind of national election fraud”\nTo understand whether mistaken mail-in ballots could lead to significant election fraud, the FRANCE 24 Observers team spoke to professors Lonna Atkeson of the University of New Mexico and Trey Hood of the University of Georgia, both specialists in election administration. \n\nDr. Hood said that erroneously sent ballots are only a threat if someone tries to use them to vote: \n\n“These administrative mistakes occur. If you’re a state that’s suddenly ramping up your mail-in balloting because of the coronavirus, there’s likely to be more mistakes made. But unless someone takes the ballot of a deceased person and votes on their behalf, it’s not fraud. Voter fraud from what we can tell is fairly rare and episodic.”"

An example of this is a municipal election earlier this year in Paterson, New Jersey that was overturned after charges of mail-in voter fraud caused nearly 20 percent of the ballots to be rejected."

            "answer": "“Security checks should prevent the most egregious acts of fraud”\nMore than half of states check the signatures on incoming mail-in ballots against signatures they have on file for registered voters, but Dr. Atkeson says that the rigour of these checks varies. \n\n    “Every state has their own more or less stringent process for qualifying ballots. In states with universal vote-by-mail like Colorado and Utah, we certainly see instances where submitted ballots are signed by someone other than the voter   and those are caught. There are security checks that should prevent the most egregious acts of fraud. However, signature matching is not an exact science, both in terms of qualifying votes that should be counted and votes that shouldn’t be counted. But I do believe that processes in place are strong attempts to assure the security of the system.”\n\nDr. Hood agrees: “It really depends on the state - the United States basically has 50 different election systems with different safeguards. North Carolina has what they call witness affirmation   someone has to sign witnessing that the person sending the ballot voted the ballot. Another safeguard is if the state -- like Georgia -- requires voters to request absentee ballots. This way, the voter is initiating the process.”"

Imagine what would have happened if 1.5 million ballots were simply mailed out to all of those individuals to addresses where they no longer live.\n\nBallots are a valuable commodity. How many would have been voted anyway by fraudsters or vote harvesters collecting absentee ballots in neighborhoods throughout Los Angeles?  \n\nJust look at what happened in North Carolina in 2018 in the 9th Congressional District race, in which the result was overturned by the state election board because of illegal vote harvesting that included altering and forging absentee ballots.\n\nAll-mail jurisdictions such as Oregon like to brag about the supposed “security” of their systems, which consists of almost nothing other than a rapid, superficial signature comparison. \n\nAs Melody Rose, an assistant professor of political science at Portland State University, told the Los Angeles Times: “I don’t have much faith in that process. I can forge my husband’s signature perfectly.”\n\nRose conducted a survey of one county, Washington County, outside Portland. Five percent of registered voters admitted that other people marked their ballots, and 2.4% said someone else signed their ballots."

            "answer": "States have multiple tools to address valid security concerns and protect election integrity when it comes to mail ballots. And recent technologies and strategies have significantly enhanced the security of mail balloting.\n\nIdentity verification: The principal method used to detect and prevent fraud is the mail ballot envelope itself, where each voter must include personal identifying information (such as address, birthday, and driver’s license number or last four digits of a Social Security number). In most states, that information includes a signature to match against the voter rolls. \n\nBar codes: Most election jurisdictions now use some form of bar code on their ballot envelopes. These bar codes allow election officials to keep track of ballot processing and help voters know whether their ballot has been received. Bar codes also allow states to identify and eliminate duplicate ballots.\n\nBallot tracking through the U.S. Postal Service: In many jurisdictions, including California, Colorado and Florida, ballot envelopes are equipped with intelligent mail bar codes to track an envelope from drop-off to delivery and processing. \n\nSecure drop-off locations and drop boxes: Multiple ballot return options limit the opportunity for ballot tampering by fostering voter independence in returning a ballot.\n\nHarsh penalties: Anyone who commits voter fraud using a mail ballot risks severe criminal and civil penalties: up to five years in prison and $10,000 in fines for each act of fraud under federal law, in addition to any state penalties.\n\nPostelection audits: In 2018, a review of returned absentee ballot records helped identify anomalies in the election results of Bladen County, North Carolina, enabling election officials to uncover election interference by a political operative who stole and tampered with mail ballots.\n\nPolling sites as a fail-safe: if there are concerns that an eligible voter’s mail ballots could be lost or uncounted, in-person polling sites provided."

Louis Hennessy, was convicted of two counts of Failure to Comply with an Emergency Order. Immediately after the trial, Judge Hennessy sentenced Myers, 42 of Hughesville, to 1 year of active incarceration to be served at the Charles County Detention Center. Upon release, Myers will be on unsupervised probation for a period of three years.\n\nOn March 22, 2020, multiple officers responded to Myers’ residence located in the 15200 block of Lukes Lane in Hughesville for the report of a large party violating Governor Larry Hogan’s State of Emergency and Large Gathering Orders. Large gatherings were strictly prohibited under the orders. Myers had approximately fifty people in attendance at his residence. Upon arrival, officers told Myers that his party violated the current mandate. Myers was argumentative with officers but eventually agreed to disband his party.\n\nLess than a week later, on March 27, 2020, officers responded back to Myers’ residence for another report of a party exceeding fifty people. Officers told Myers to disband the party, but again he was argumentative claiming he and his guests had the right to congregate. Beyond being argumentative, Myers directed his guests to stay in defiance of Governor Hogan’s Orders and the officers’ lawful orders to disband the party. Officers tried to reason with Myers and obtain his cooperation to no avail.Myers was then apprehended.\n\nCount 1 –Failure to Comply with an Emergency Order\n\nGuilty\n6 months suspended/$1,000 fine suspended\nCount 2 –Failure to Comply with an Emergency Order\n\nGuilty\n1 year in jail and $5,000 fine\n3 years unsupervised probation"

The contaminated waste gas formed aerosols that contained the bacteria and got carried into the city by the wind.\n\nAccording to CNN, the Health Commission of Lanzhou, the capital city of Gansu province, confirmed that 3,245 people had contracted the disease. Another 1,401 people have tested as preliminarily positive, though there have been no fatalities reported."

While teaching at Rutgers University, she took on a few cases for the American Civil Liberties Union, then founded the ACLU’s Women’s Rights project, where her storied career as an advocate for gender equality began. In 1980, she was confirmed for the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, and in 1993 she became an associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court.

Virginia, ruling that the state could not continue to operate an all-male educational institution (the Virginia Military Institute) with taxpayer dollars. She also joined in the majority opinion in Stenberg v. Carhart (2000), striking down a Nebraska law banning so-called “partial birth” abortions. She dissented vehemently in Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire (2007), in which an Alabama woman sued unsuccessfully for back pay to compensate for the years in which she had been paid substantially less than junior male colleagues performing the same job.

In his statement, McConnell said: “President Trump’s nominee will receive a vote on the floor of the United States Senate.”\n\nMcConnell’s words have been controversial for many. Following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in 2016, President Obama selected a candidate for his replacement. However, Obama’s replacement (Merrick Garland) never became a Justice.\n\nMcConnell and other Republican Senators would not hold any hearings on the potential new Justice. Their reasoning was that the people ought to choose the next Supreme Court Justice by proxy through the upcoming presidential election. That election came and went, with Donald Trump winning and eventually appointing Brett Kavanaugh as the next Justice."

            "answer": "Netflix is catching some serious flak on social media today around their upcoming original film Cuties — most of which likely could have been avoided.\n\nCuties, a film from French-Senegalese director Maïmouna Doucouré, made its debut in January at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival. Decider was there in Park City for the screening, and our Senior Film Reporter Anna Menta filed a review of Cuties, calling it a “coming-of-age film that will speak volumes to anyone who has lived through the agonizingly confusing time that is girlhood.”\n\nEarlier this week, Netflix announced the premiere date of Cuties (September 9) and released the trailer for the film, which immediately set off a firestorm of criticism from hordes of angry keyboard warriors —most of whom, we assume, have yet to actually see the movie— who found some fresh ammunition for the culture wars. The first part of the problem arose from the language that Netflix used to describe the film on their official movie page, as well as YouTube. That language read:\n\n    Amy, 11, becomes fascinated with a twerking dance crew. Hoping to join them, she starts to explore her femininity, defying her family’s traditions.\n\nEver since Miley Cyrus set the world aflame in 2013 by bringing the twerking dance craze into the mainstream — putting “cultural appropriation” directly into the crosshairs of the outrage economy on both sides of the political spectrum — the word “twerking” has been a loaded term. Combining that term with the precocious age of the film’s primary protagonist, an 11-year-old girl, left the rabid (and scarily thriving) QAnon community foaming at the mouth; it was the cultural equivalent of throwing red meat to Joe Exotic’s menagerie of underfed tigers. The movie’s TV-MA rating further incited Twitter users to accuse Netflix of making “child porn,” of being run “by a bunch of pedophiles,” and much worse. (We don’t even want to imagine what’s being said on Parlor.)\n\nPresumably realizing that they were under fire, Net"

That's a phenomenon called Mie scattering, and it's why skies turn orange and red due to wildfire smoke (it doesn't have to do with the color of the flames themselves)."

            "answer": "The reason for the sky turning red is the way smoke particles scatter sunlight. Smoke particles are fairly large and are better at scattering the longer (red) wavelengths of light, known as Mie scattering. If there a sufficient amount of smoke, Mie scattering will dominate over Rayleigh scattering, which is how light is primarily scattered in the atmosphere. This causes the red and orange colored sky."

The campaign over the past four years in the far west region of Xinjiang is leading to what some experts are calling a form of “demographic genocide.”\n\nThe state regularly subjects minority women to pregnancy checks, and forces intrauterine devices, sterilization and even abortion on hundreds of thousands, the interviews and data show. Even while the use of IUDs and sterilization has fallen nationwide, it is rising sharply in Xinjiang.\n\nThe population control measures are backed by mass detention both as a threat and as a punishment for failure to comply. Having too many children is a major reason people are sent to detention camps, the AP found, with the parents of three or more ripped away from their families unless they can pay huge fines. Police raid homes, terrifying parents as they search for hidden children."

            "answer": "Sterilizations, iuds, and mandatory birth control: the ccp’s campaign to suppress uyghur birthrates in xinjiang:\n\nNatural population growth in Xinjiang has declined dramatically; growth rates fell by 84 percent in the two largest Uyghur prefectures between 2015 and 2018, and declined further in several minority regions in 2019. For 2020, one Uyghur region set an unprecedented near-zero birth rate target: a mere 1.05 per mille, compared to 19.66 per mille in 2018. This was intended to be achieved through “family planning work.”\n\nIn 2018, natural population growth plummeted: to 4.06‰ in all minority regions and 2.58‰ in Kashgar and\nHotan. - In a drastic reversal of long-standing historic trends, the declines in Uyghur population growth have occurred mainly in the countryside. For example, Keriya County in Hotan had one of Xinjiang’s highest natural population growth rates in previous years, with rates being nearly double those of Hotan City. Its first marked decline occurred in 2016, but the by far most dramatic drop (to -0.49‰) took place in 2018.\n\nIn 2018, minority regions in Xinjiang also deployed mass health exams to identify family planning violations. Campaigns such as “testing all who need to be tested” (体检实现应检尽检, tijian shixian ying jian jin yian) were associated with curbing such violations (Yining City, January 22, 2019). “Zero birth control violation incidents” (违法生育零发生, weifa shengyu ling fasheng), a term that was not routinely used elsewhere in the PRC nor in Xinjiang prior to 2018, became a standard family planning target in 2018 and 2019. A particularly strict case here is Hotan Prefecture, a region with a population of 2.53 million, which in 2019 planned to have no more than exactly 21 birth control policy violations. According to\nZhaosu County’s family planning work report, “zero” violations meant that all involved government units on\nall levels had to sign solemn pledges promising to achieve that goal."

The FOP knew at the beginning of the pandemic that law enforcement officers on the front lines combating this pandemic—more than 90% of whom will be responding from local and State agencies—would be increasingly vulnerable to contracting the virus. COVID-19 makes no distinction between age, race or gender. As we had feared, the virus has claimed the lives of many, and now includes a growing number of law enforcement officers.\n\nPlease Note: The following list has been compiled using media and news reports of law enforcement officers who have died due to COVID-19. The numbers listed include all reported COVID-19 deaths—not all have been verified. The FOP’s goal is to maintain an accurate and up-to-date list and is working around the clock to support our members as we all respond to the national pandemic. To ensure that every officer is accounted for, if you are aware of an officer that has died in the line of duty due to COVID-19, please feel free to send an email to Mark McDonald with the officer’s information and a link to either a media report or obituary.\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out to us via email at media@fop.net.\nTotal Deaths (As of June 18, 2021)\n\n493\nState\n\nAlabama\n    6\nAlaska\n    0\nAmerican Samoa\n    0\nArizona\n    11\nArkansas\n    3\nCalifornia\n    49\nColorado\n    3\nConnecticut\n    1\nDelaware\n    0\nFlorida\n    30\nGeorgia\n    23\nGuam\n    2\nHawaii\n    0\nIdaho\n    0\nIllinois\n    13\nIndiana\n    3\nIowa\n    2\nKansas\n    6\nKentucky\n    5\nLouisiana\n    25\nMaine\n    0\nMaryland\n    6\nMassachusetts\n    5\nMichigan\n    12\nMinnesota\n    1\nMississippi\n    4\nMissouri\n    4\nMontana\n    1\nNebraska\n    2\nNevada\n    2\nNew Hampshire\n    0\nNew Jersey\n    18\nNew Mexico\n    0\nNew York\n    44\nNorth Carolina\n    16\nNorth Dakota\n    0\nOhio\n    14\nOklahoma\n    4\nOregon\n    0\nPennsylvania\n    16\nPuerto Rico\n    7\nRhode Island"

A judge has discretion whether or not to place the defendant on the sex offender registry. By contrast, if the sexual act is oral sex, anal sex or digital penetration, the court must place the defendant on the sex offender registry regardless of the facts of the crime and even in cases where the prosecutor does not want to place the defendant on the registry.

The vast, vast majority of cases where a judge may decide NOT to put someone on the registry will be cases where the age range is close (such as 17-year-old and 18-year-old couple).

The only change is that a judge can decide, when the sexual contact is oral, anal or digital, whether or not the older party should be on the sex offender registry – if the couple is close in age and the behavior was voluntary.

The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) requires hospitals to stabilize all low-income individuals with life-threatening conditions, and Emergency Medicaid covers emergency services for immigrants who would otherwise qualify for Medicaid but for their immigration status. Thus, undocumented patients often receive care much later in the course of diseases, as documented in a study of New York City public hospitals. Often, individuals return repeatedly to emergency departments for the same condition. By delaying needed care, undocumented persons face serious, more costly, health conditions in the long term. Shifting toward prevention and early diagnosis and treatment would avoid or reduce costs over time.\n\nThus, expanding coverage for undocumented immigrants could save costs over all."

His plan would make the electricity sector free of carbon pollution by 2035; make all new U.S.-made buses zero-emissions by 2030; set a goal for disadvantaged communities to receive 40% of benefits from \"clean energy\" and infrastructure spending; and create a net-zero emissions standard for all new commercial buildings by 2030. \n\nBiden is aiming to move toward a less carbon-intensive economy by creating millions of jobs to help reshape the country’s energy, transportation and infrastructure sectors, with workers being able to join unions and collectively bargain."

Instead, it refers to a 14-page resolution sponsored by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., that lays out a series of broad goals and guiding principles and then leaves it to lawmakers to figure out how to meet them.\n\nThe resolution calls for “a new national, social, industrial and economic mobilization on a scale not seen since World War II and the New Deal,” one that over 10 years would move to renewable energy for electricity, and make transportation, housing, agriculture and manufacturing more energy-efficient. The goal is to create millions of new jobs in clean energy and get to net-zero emissions by 2050, not only in the United States, but around the world."

In addition, the new plan includes a proposal to create an Environmental and Climate Justice Division within the Justice Department. That idea was previously proposed by Democratic Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, who made climate change central to his presidential bid. Inslee supports Biden’s new approach."

It found that while parents and carers reported that the emotional difficulties of adolescents decreased, the emotional difficulties of children aged four to ten increased. \n\nAlso a potential contributor to feelings of anxiety among students during the pandemic has been the uncertainty over exam results, which would have primarily affected students in years 11 and 13, not year 9 (as the study itself notes)."

Repeat infections by the same virus are met immediately with a strong and specific response that usually effectively stops the infection with less reliance on the innate system. When we say we are immune to infection with a virus, we are talking about immune memory. Vaccines protect us against infection because of immune memory. The first adaptive response against a virus – called the primary response – often takes days to mature. In contrast, a memory response develops within hours of infection. Memory is maintained by a subset of B and T lymphocytes called memory cells which survive for years in the body. Memory cells remain ready to respond rapidly and efficiently to a subsequent encounter with a pathogen. This so-called secondary response is often stronger than the primary response to infection. Consequently, childhood infections protect adults, and immunity conferred by vaccination can last for years."

Aleman says, one thing is becoming clear: antibodies might not be telling the whole story when it comes to COVID-19 immunity. “We shouldn’t just look blindly at antibody tests.\" The article also states, Aleman and other virologists and immunologists when turning their attention to COVID-19, they began to study how immunity developed in people who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, as well as their close contacts, some of whom were presumably exposed to the virus, even if they didn’t get sick. As expected, hospitalized individuals developed strong antibody and T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2. But two-thirds of the close contacts who were asymptomatic showed a subsequent T cell response, even though tests didn’t detect any antibodies - Study results, released June 29 without peer review via the medical pre-print service medRxiv, didn’t reveal whether these individuals never developed antibodies or whether they rapidly declined to undetectable levels. Regardless, the report immediately raised concerns about a vaccine, since stimulating antibody production is a key strategy by which immunizations protect against disease.\n\nThe article also cites recently reported work by immunologist Antonio Bertoletti from Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore - Patients infected with the original SARS virus still possessed memory T cells that responded to the virus’ proteins 17 years later. These same memory T cells also reacted to SARS-CoV-2. It’s something Bertoletti says bodes well for COVID-19."

The CARES Act implemented a fixed supplement to all workers in part because it\nwas viewed as infeasible to implement policies which depended on individual earnings. Since the $600 UI\nsupplement was targeted to generate 100% earnings replacement based on mean earnings, this $600 sup-\nplement tends to imply greater than 100% earnings replacement for those with less than mean earnings.\nFurthermore, these high replacement rates for below-mean workers are amplified by the fact that the dis-\ntribution of earnings is skewed: median earnings are less than mean earnings. This means that the typical\nunemployed worker has below-mean prior earnings and thus above-mean replacement rates. This implies\nthat most workers have replacement rates above 100%."

Minks can act as a reservoir of SARS-CoV-2, passing the virus between them, and pose a risk for virus spill-over from mink to humans. People can then transmit this virus within the human population. Additionally, spill-back (human to mink transmission) can occur. It remains a concern when any animal virus spills in to the human population, or when an animal population could contribute to amplifying and spreading a virus affecting humans. As viruses move between human and animal populations, genetic modifications in the virus can occur. These changes can be identified through whole genome sequencing, and when found, experiments can study the possible implications of these changes on the disease in humans."

Treatment is time-consuming and expensive as it involves undergoing long-term therapy with chelating agents, which remove heavy metals from the body.\n\nTreatment also involves persuading people to adopt new practices and behaviours, something which requires an ongoing effort from authorities to continuously raise awareness and make sure the population follows preventive measures.\n\nAccording to WHO, children in seven villages in Zamfara state require chelation therapy. This is in addition to the residents of seven other villages who have already received treatment. In these villages the combined effects of removing children from lead exposure and providing chelation therapy caused the child mortality rate to drop from 43 per cent to 1 per cent in one year.\n\nSince the problem was discovered last year, $1.9 million has been provided by the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) to WHO and the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF), which have been used to provide treatment, train doctors, provide quick diagnoses, and raise awareness about the hazards of lead."

Cell phones generate radio-frequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF), resulting in local exposure of the human body to RF-EMF. Concerns have been raised regarding the potential effects of RF-EMF exposure on human health. Short-term exposure in adults is regarded as safe; however, potential health effects of long-term exposure and exposure of fetuses and children are not well studied (2, 3).\n\nThe interpretation of results from epidemiologic studies evaluating health effects of RF-EMF exposure from cell-phone use is challenging. Because of the technical evolution of mobile communication systems, similar levels of cell-phone use do not necessarily induce similar levels of RF-EMF exposure. Users’ exposure to RF-EMF from third-generation (3G) devices is much lower than that from second-generation (2G) devices (4). More recent technologies (4G/5G) also differ from 3G devices, though less, in terms of users’ exposure."

            "answer": "Longtime Republican Clint Eastwood is pulling support from Donald Trump in the 2020 election. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, the actor-director signaled that he thinks a different candidate would be the better choice.\n\n“The best thing we could do is just get Mike Bloomberg in there,” he said.\n\nAfter endorsing Mitt Romney and famously delivering a speech at the 2012 Republican National Convention to an empty chair that represented Barack Obama, Eastwood never officially backed Trump. In a 2016 interview, he expressed displeasure with Trump and Hillary Clinton, saying there’s “much funny business on both sides of the aisle.”\n\nHe praised Trump at the time because he was “onto something” and “secretly everybody’s getting tired of political correctness, kissing up.”\n\n“We’re really in a p—y generation. Everybody’s walking on eggshells. We see people accusing people of being racist and all kinds of stuff. When I grew up, those things weren’t called racist,” he said.\n\nNow, he’s changed his tune a bit on Trump.\n\nWhile he approves of “certain things” the president has done, he wishes that he would act “in a more genteel way, without tweeting and calling people names. I would personally like for him to not bring himself to that level,” he said.\n\nEastwood also touched on the controversy surrounding Olivia Wilde’s character, Kathy Scruggs, in his 2019 film “Richard Jewell.” He showed Scruggs, the real-life reporter who alleged Jewell planted a bomb at the 1996 Olympics, sleeping with an FBI source to get information. Lawyers for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, the newspaper at which Scruggs worked, called the portrayal “entirely false and malicious, and…extremely defamatory and damaging.” The film was Clintwood’s worst opening in 40 years.\n\nThe director defended his right to cinematic freedom and said the newspaper was trying to shroud its “guilt” over a “reckless story.”\n\n“Well, she hung out at a little bar in town, where mostly police officers went,” he said"

The achievement of the 10% required or more would be realized if the\ndevolved monies held at the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Irrigation, are\nreleased to Counties. The Council will continue to pursue reforms in this sector to\nensure the best interest of the farmers in the Counties is achieved.\n On the overall, the performance of the agriculture sector in the year 2018/2019\nsignificantly improved as per the Economic Survey report 2019.

It also absorbs infrared radiation emitted by the Earth's surface, effectively trapping heat in the troposphere. Therefore, the climate impact of changes in ozone concentrations varies with the altitude at which these ozone changes occur. The major ozone losses that have been observed in the lower stratosphere due to the human-produced chlorine- and bromine-containing gases have a cooling effect on the Earth's surface. On the other hand, the ozone increases that are estimated to have occurred in the troposphere because of surface-pollution gases have a warming effect on the Earth's surface, thereby contributing to the \"greenhouse\" effect."

Some cause illness in people, and others, such as canine and feline coronaviruses, only infect animals. Rarely, coronaviruses that infect animals have emerged to infect people and can spread between people. This is suspected to have occurred for the virus that causes COVID-19.  Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are two other examples of coronaviruses that originated in animals and then spread to people."

Progressive reformers bristled—arguing that too often, judges ascribe dangerousness in ways that amplify the racial discrimination that pervades the justice system. Ultimately, they pursued a compromise that did not add dangerousness but preserved bail only for the most serious crimes."

Federal law also requires states to conduct basic list maintenance.\n\nOnce voting begins, the linchpin of the process is a ballot return envelope, which typically requires the voter’s signature and includes a unique bar code linked to that voter’s record. When the ballot is returned and the bar code is scanned, no other ballot can be cast by that voter for that election.\n\nElection officials and security experts said certain measures are important for preventing fraud in mail voting, such as accurate voter rolls and a method of authenticating ballots such as signature matching. Such safeguards have been put in place over time in the five states that currently run universal mail elections: Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Utah and Washington.\n\nThe other mainstay of election security in vote-by-mail states is the signature verification process. Election workers are trained by law enforcement agencies to detect when a signature on the ballot envelope does not match signatures in a voter’s file. Discrepancies trigger a review that could end with a voter proving his or her identity — or being reported to law enforcement for possible ballot tampering.\n\nAll-mail states have implemented a range of other safeguards to ensure ballots are secure at all times, including dropboxes under 24-hour surveillance cameras, rules that two people be present with any ballot from the moment of receipt or collection, and detailed logs and reconciliation rules that require votes to be accounted for, down to the ballot."

It is likely to have its ancestral origins in a bat species (1,2) but it probably reached humans through an intermediary species (pangolins have been suggested) (3,4), or mutated within humans to be able to be transmitted between people and cause disease (3). This is a priority area for research but it is important to note that subsequent transmission of COVID-19 is from person to person.

            "answer": "In 2008 (a few months before Starmer became director of public prosecutions [DPP] at the CPS) Sussex Police launched an investigation into a possible sexual assault, but took no further action as the complainant did not wish to give evidence.  In 2009 the CPS reviewed four sexual assault claims against Savile and felt there was insufficient evidence with which to proceed - again, because none of Savile's accusers were prepared to support police action. Frankly, the CPS makes a lot of decisions like this and it would be strange for the director himself to make the decision personally - that's the responsibility of the reviewing lawyer. We may well question that decision, but asking whether there was in fact sufficient evidence is one thing; to assume that such evidence would have resulted in a conviction is quite another. Have any of us seen the evidence the CPS was presented with?  Have those spinning these accusations - or spreading them - actually spoken with any of those who brought the initial complaints against Savile? Starmer took over a CPS under fire on various fronts and, after 2011, especially on the Savile issue. While he had no personal involvement in the decision not to proceed, Starmer did commission a review, headed by Alison Levitt QC, in which he revealed failures at the heart of the CPS and in 2013 issued an apology. He acknowledged those failures, pledging to change the culture of the CPS and its internal mechanisms. A \"fundamental shift\" was required, he argued, as \"we cannot afford another Savile moment in five or ten years. While \"no improper motives\" were found, the Evening Standard reported that one of the review's major criticisms was that \"the CPS lawyer (my italics) should have challenged the police conclusions and sought to build a prosecution against Savile\". It also suggested the complainants should have been informed that there had been other complaints about Savile, as this would potentially have encouraged them to give evidence. This"

Absentee Ballot Request Form before the deadline. The request must be signed and include identifying information about the voter, including date of birth and driver’s license number or last four digits of the voter’s Social Security number. Voters must vote their ballot in the presence of two witnesses or a notary, and those witnesses must sign the absentee return envelope certifying that the voter marked their ballot and is the registered voter submitting the marked ballot.\n\nOnly the voter or their near relative or legal guardian may return the ballot. Upon return, the county board of elections reviews the absentee envelope to ensure compliance with the legal requirements. Once the ballot is accepted, that voter is marked in the system as having voted in that election.\n\nData on who has requested absentee ballots is now confidential until Election Day. Criminal penalties have been increased for absentee voting fraud-related offenses. Many people are watching our absentee voting process, including candidates, political parties, county boards of elections, and political and data scientists. If there are anomalies or questionable activities, they will be identified by or reported to election officials.\n\nFinally, the State Board of Elections has an Investigations Division that investigates credible allegations of elections fraud and refers cases to prosecutors when warranted by the evidence. The State Board also conducts several post-election audits which will catch inconsistencies that can then be investigated by the board or the Investigations Division."

          {
            "answer": "The movement was born in 2013, after the man who shot and killed an unarmed black teenager, Trayvon Martin, was cleared of his murder. A Californian activist, Alicia Garza, responded to the jury’s decision on Facebook with a post that ended: “Black people. I love you. I love us. Our lives matter.” The hashtag was born, and continued to grow in prominence with each new incident and protest.\n\nThe formal organization that sprung from the protests started with the goal of highlighting the disproportionate number of incidences in which a police officer killed a member of the black community. But it soon gained international recognition, after the death of Michael Brown in Missouri a year later.\n\nBlack Lives Matter now describes itself as a “chapter-based national organization working for the validity of black life”. It has developed to include the issues of black women and LGBT communities, undocumented black people and black people with disabilities."

These are my orders: Not three days after, but now. This is war. I meant it, every bit of it.”"

At that time the police chiefs picked up this statement where the looting starts, the shooting starts . \nThis phrase aimed to instill fear in African Americans. Trump’s use of the slogan retains that power, Pauley said, \"while simultaneously communicating a tough, law-and-order ethos to his supporters."

Throughout the ancient world, anyone who functioned as a servant was usually a slave.\n\nIn the kind of servitude called slavery, the laborer is considered property. He or she can be bought and sold like any other commodity. The origins of slavery are unknown, but it probably emerged as an economic necessity or convenience when people began to establish permanent communities based on agriculture."

Democrats on the committee suggested Gowdy's line of questioning was unfair and politically motivated.\n\n\"If you think we've heard about Sidney Blumenthal, wait for the next round!\" Gowdy declared before abruptly calling a recess in the middle of the marathon hearing.\n\nGowdy questioned why Clinton exchanged so many emails with Blumenthal pertaining to Libya, even though Blumenthal \"could not get hired by our government... had never been to Libya, [and] had no expertise with Libya.\"\n\n    Hillary Clinton's Benghazi testimony: A viewer's guide\n    What Hillary Clinton will say before the Benghazi panel\n\nGowdy suggested it was suspicious that Blumenthal, \"all the while working with the Clinton Foundation and some pseudo-news entities, had unfettered access to you.\" By contrast, Gowdy said that Clinton's records showed \"not a single email to and from Ambassador [Chris] Stevens,\" the administration's trusted man on the ground in Libya and one of the four Americans killed in the September 11, 2012 attack on a U.S. facility in Benghazi."

            "answer": "The moment Hillary Clinton seemed to realize that her testimony Thursday before the House Select Committee on Benghazi was not going to be a big problem for her or for her campaign came about forty-five minutes in. When the hearing opened, she had regarded the chairman, Trey Gowdy, of South Carolina, with irritated skepticism. She looked as if she might say something rash, if not throw something, and perhaps she might have. Nearly three years ago, in a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on Benghazi, she lashed out after having been asked many times about U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice’s comments on the Sunday talk shows about what had instigated the attack, on September 11, 2012, in which four Americans, including Chris Stevens, the Ambassador to Libya, died. “What difference, at this point, does it make?” Clinton demanded. Out of context, she sounded unmoved by the men’s deaths. Now, in the House hearing, it seemed to dawn on her that the proper response to her Republican interrogators was not outrage but pity.\n\nPeter Roskam, of Illinois, was laying out a scenario in which Clinton’s assumption of a leadership role on Libyan policy “didn’t come easy,” when he stopped and said, in case he might be overwhelming her, “I can pause while you’re reading your notes from your staff.” Clinton replied, “I can do more than one thing at a time, Congressman—thanks.” A minute or two later, Roskam said, “Go ahead and read the note if you need to.” This time, Clinton laughed. “I’m not done with my question,” Roskam said; he was just doing her a “courtesy.” “That’s all right,” Clinton responded, with a friendly wave of her hand. From then on, she was in control. “I’m sorry that doesn’t fit your narrative, Congressman. I can only tell you what the facts are,” she told Jim Jordan, of Ohio, who is the chairman of the Freedom Caucus. As he spoke, she rested her chin on the palm of one hand, as if he were not much more than a loud boor at a party who, puzzlingly, doesn’t seem to kn"

Fact checking is not censorship, it is more speech. This is a clear attempt to push  companies into moderating content in line with the President’s interpretation of free speech, ahead of a divisive presidential election where social media will be a key campaigning battleground.”\n\nThe Executive Order seeks to undermine protections in Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. This shields online intermediaries from liability for what their users say and protects intermediaries’ ability to moderate content on their  platforms. Intermediaries include Internet Service Providers and social media platforms, such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. Platforms also have their own free speech rights and their editorial functions are protected under the First Amendment.\n\nMcKew added: “Rather than protecting free speech, undermining Section 230 in this way will restrict more speech online. It will make it easier for the government itself to exert the levers of censorship, fundamentally undermining First Amendment rights in the United States.”\n\nThe row between Twitter and the President looks set to intensify after the social media platform marked tweets which threatened the use of force in the wake of civil unrest in Minneapolis as in violation of rules about glorifying violence. This is the first time Twitter uses such a label against a head of state and the US President in particular. In line with Twitter policy, the tweet was not removed as Twitter said it might be in the public interest but the public interest notice “limits the ability to engage with the Tweet"

Biden said it’s evidence that Trump already is trying to “undermine” the election and make it more difficult for Americans to vote.\n\n“We have to make it easier for everybody to be able to vote, particularly if we are still basically in the kind of lockdown circumstances we are in now,” Biden told about 650 donors. “But that takes a lot of money, and it’s going to require us to provide money for states and insist they provide mail-in ballots.”\n\nIt’s perhaps Biden's most explicit call for a national mail election since COVID-19 upended the 2020 campaign and every aspect of American life. The former vice president doesn’t propose eliminating in-person voting. But he said state and local officials must do more to make polling locations conform to public health protocols, while steering voters toward other options."

The vessel may be any vein or artery as for example, in a deep vein thrombosis (venous) or a coronary artery (arterial). The clot itself is termed a thrombus.\nOnce formed, a clot can slow or block normal blood flow, and even break loose and travel to an organ. A clot that travels to the circulation is called an embolism. Thrombosis is the often preventable underlying pathology of heart attack, thromboembolic stroke, and venous thromboembolism (VTE), the top three cardiovascular killers."

Women also live on average six years longer than men, so there are more elderly women than men in the vulnerable population.\n\nThe other major factor is the presence of chronic diseases, particularly heart disease, diabetes and cancer. These are all more common in men than women, which might account for some of the bias."

There was no federal reserve system when Lincoln was president. The Federal Reserve System was not established until 1913.\n\n2. Prior to the Federal Reserve System, there had been a national bank*, and Andrew Jackson had made its end one of his key second-term goals.\n\n3. Two assassins attempted to kill Jackson, but no evidence suggests that they were sent by the Bank.**\n\n4. Some people have emphasized the eerie similarities between Lincoln and Kennedy, which are easily explainable.\n\n* There were two national banks, in fact: The 1st Bank of the U.S., which was chartered from 1791-1811 and the 2nd Bank of the U.S., chartered from 1816-1836.\n\n** There is that pesky Booth letter, though."

Following plasma transfusion, body temperature normalized within 3 days in 4 of 5 patients, the SOFA score decreased, and Pao2/Fio2 increased within 12 days (range, 172-276 before and 284-366 after). Viral loads also decreased and became negative within 12 days after the transfusion, and SARS-CoV-2–specific ELISA and neutralizing antibody titers increased following the transfusion (range, 40-60 before and 80-320 on day 7). ARDS resolved in 4 patients at 12 days after transfusion, and 3 patients were weaned from mechanical ventilation within 2 weeks of treatment. Of the 5 patients, 3 have been discharged from the hospital (length of stay: 53, 51, and 55 days), and 2 are in stable condition at 37 days after transfusion.\n\nConclusions and Relevance  In this preliminary uncontrolled case series of 5 critically ill patients with COVID-19 and ARDS, administration of convalescent plasma containing neutralizing antibody was followed by improvement in their clinical status. The limited sample size and study design preclude a definitive statement about the potential effectiveness of this treatment, and these observations require evaluation in clinical trials."

            "answer": "COVID-19 is currently a big threat to global health. However, no specific antiviral agents are available for its treatment. In this work, we explored the feasibility of convalescent plasma (CP) transfusion to rescue severe patients. The results from 10 severe adult cases showed that one dose (200 mL) of CP was welltolerated and could significantly increase or maintain the neutralizing antibodies at a high level, leading to disappearance of viremia in 7 days. Meanwhile, clinical symptoms and paraclinical criteria rapidly improved within 3 days. Radiological examination showed varying degrees of absorption of lung lesions within 7 days. These results indicate that CP can serve as a promising rescue option for severe COVID-19 while the randomized trial is warranted."

Influenza A viruses were the predominant circulating viruses last year. While influenza A(H1N1pdm09) viruses predominated from October 2018 – mid February 2019, influenza A(H3N2) viruses were more commonly reported starting in late February 2019. Influenza B viruses were not commonly reported among circulating viruses during the 2018–2019 season. The season had moderate severity based on levels of outpatient influenza-like illness, hospitalizations rates, and proportions of pneumonia and influenza-associated deaths.\n\nCDC estimates that the burden of illness during the 2018–2019 season included an estimated 35.5 million people getting sick with influenza, 16.5 million people going to a health care provider for their illness, 490,600 hospitalizations, and 34,200 deaths from influenza (Table 1). The number of influenza-associated illnesses that occurred last season was similar to the estimated number of influenza-associated illnesses during the 2012–2013 influenza season when an estimated 34 million people had symptomatic influenza illness6.\n\nPeak activity during the 2018–2019 influenza season was classified as having moderate severity across ages in the population. Compared with the 2017–2018 season , which was classified as high severity, the overall rates and burden of influenza were much lower during the 2018–2019 season (Table 2). Among children, however, rates of influenza during the 2018–2019 season were similar to the 2017–2018 season. In addition, the 2018–2019 season had two waves of activity, including a wave predominated by influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses and another wave of similar magnitude attributable to influenza A(H3N2) viruses5. The dual waves resulted in a protracted season during 2018–2019 that was less severe when compared with peak activity in 2017–2018, but r"

Radiofrequency exposure levels from current technologies result in negligible temperature rise in the human body.\n\nAs the frequency increases, there is less penetration into the body tissues and absorption of the energy becomes more confined to the surface of the body (skin and eye). Provided that the overall exposure remains below international guidelines, no consequences for public health are anticipated."

            "answer": "Prevention Strategies in Alignment With the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\nBehavior\n\nWear a Mask: When in public settings or when around people outside of your household, wear a properly-fitting cloth face covering. Wash your hands before putting on your face covering, put it over your nose and mouth and secure it under your chin, and try to fit it snugly against the sides of your face. Make sure you can still breathe easily.\n\nHand washing: The most well-established way to prevent respiratory infections such as influenza and coronavirus is frequent and thorough hand washing with soap and water. Scrub your hands thoroughly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.\n\nHand sanitizer: Handwashing with soap and water is the best way to reduce germs, but if they are not available, alcohol-based hand sanitizers that contain at least 60% alcohol can help to reduce the spread of infection. Note: avoid any products containing triclosan, a known hormone-disrupting chemical.\n\nCovering your mouth and nose: Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing; if your hands are not free or you don’t have a tissue, cough or sneeze into your sleeve, not your bare hands.\n\nNot touching your face: Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands, which can help provide the virus with a route of entry into the body. Since the average individual touches their face an average of 15 times per hour, remain vigilant!\n\nKeeping surfaces clean: Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces, especially when someone is ill. Surfaces to consider include doorknobs, phones, computer keyboards, remotes, and other surfaces that are frequently touched in rooms such as the bathroom and kitchen.\nLifestyle\n\nStress reduction: Chronic stress can negatively alter immune system responses, making you more likely to get sick. Identify your personal stress reduction strategies and practice them regularly.\n\nSleep: Sleep has a big influence on immune function, so it is es"

        "answers": [
          {
            "answer": "COVID-19 can be transmitted by people with the virus coughing or sneezing, releasing tiny contaminated droplets into the air, putting anyone within range in danger of inhaling them. These droplets can travel more than a metre from the infected person, allowing them to settle on any surfaces ready to be transferred to anyone that touches the surface.\n\nThe virus can live on some surfaces for several days. Data from the 2003 SARS outbreak, which was a similar illness to the latest coronavirus, showed the virus could contaminate plastered walls for up to a day and a half, plastic and stainless steel for 72 hours, and glass for 96 hours. So it’s likely the mobile phone, tablet or computer screen you are reading this on could harbour COVID-19 for up to four days, and be transferred to anyone touching the screen.\n\nAdopting good hygiene is one of the most effective weapons to slow or prevent the virus spreading. Here are six things you can do to protect yourself and others.\n\n\n1. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth\n\nOur hands touch door handles, keyboards, taps and numerous other surfaces, so the virus could easily be picked up this way. Rubbing tired eyes or touching your nose or mouth could transfer the virus from your hands into your body.\n\n2. Wash your hands regularly\n\nClean your hands thoroughly and often, using plenty of soap and water or an alcohol-based hand rub to kill any virus on your hands. Scrub for at least 20 seconds, making sure you clean fingers, thumbs and palms.\n\n\n\n3. Practise respiratory hygiene\n\n\nIf you cough or sneeze, use a tissue and throw it in the trash afterwards. If you don’t have a tissue, cough into the crook of your arm instead of using your hand. If possible, avoid coughing or sneezing near other people.\n\n4. Maintain social distancing\n\nBe aware of people around you and keep your distance from anyone coughing or sneezing. Stay at least 1 metre away to prevent inhaling the small liquid droplets sprayed by coughs and sneezes."

It also weakens your immune system and could make you much more vulnerable to viruses, including HIV.\n\nTo see how alcohol affects resistance to infection, Gyongyi Szabo of the University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester and colleagues exposed monocytes – white blood cells involved in the front-line defence against infection – to chemicals that mimic viruses and bacteria. Half of the cells were also soused in the levels of alcohol that a person might have in their blood after quaffing four or five alcoholic drinks daily for a week.\n\nAlcohol blunted the monocytes’ defences. When the over-the-limit cells were exposed to a virus mimic, they produced only a quarter as much of the virus-fighting signalling molecule called type-1 interferon as teetotal monocytes made.\n\n“Interferon is pivotal, the first response to any viral infection,” says Szabo. “There’s no viral elimination without it.”"

Throughout the day, wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.\n\nIt may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging. You should always handle and prepare food safely, including keeping raw meat separate from other foods, refrigerating perishable foods, and cooking meat to the right temperature to kill harmful germs.

            "answer": "The fatality rate of the coronavirus was based on current data available of known positive cases and known deaths.\nOftentimes estimates have to be made because data is just not yet available. The Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, used the fatality rate of coronavirus with known numbers and used this as his prediction of eventual mortality rate.  This was a faulty assumption.  Estimates usually involve obtaining information that is available and making estimates on what is not. We cannot tell the future but we can make educated guesses based on information available. This is what has been done with the coronavirus because this type of virus has apparently never been seen before.\n\n2. Sometimes estimates are reasonable and sometimes they are wrong, and even way off.\nAdvertisement - story continues below\n\nThe point is that whenever estimates are made of large unknown values they are always wrong because no one can tell the future. Sometimes estimates end up close and sometimes they are not and sometimes they are way off.\n\n3. The current “estimate” for the coronavirus fatality rate according to the WHO is about 3.4%.\nThe estimate used most often is from the WHO based on the Director General’s comments.  The WHO estimates the mortality rate of the coronavirus to be around 3.4%:\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated the mortality rate from Covid-19 is about 3.4%. That is higher than seasonal flu and is cause for concern – but even if it is correct, more than 96% of people who become infected with the coronavirus will recover.\n\nAdvertisement - story continues below\n\n4. The same rate for this year’s seasonal flu is 10% if you use known cases and known deaths (but the media tells you it’s .1%).\nAs The Gateway Pundit reported earlier, according to CDC numbers, in the US in the 2019-2020 flu season, there were 222,552 confirmed cases of the flu from testing and an estimated 36 million flu cases in the United States"

As the coronavirus spread, this would not be enough.\n\nIf even 5 percent of the 325 million people living in America got Covid-19, the data suggested that 20 percent of them — 3.2 million people — would require hospitalization and 6 percent — 960,000 people — would require beds in intensive care units for many days.

Industry and governments must act quickly to boost supply, ease export restrictions and put measures in place to stop speculation and hoarding. We can’t stop COVID-19 without protecting health workers first,” said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.\n\nSince the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, prices have surged. Surgical masks have seen a sixfold increase, N95 respirators have trebled and gowns have doubled.\n\nSupplies can take months to deliver and market manipulation is widespread, with stocks frequently sold to the highest bidder."

A salt water gargle can be made by mixing 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of salt to 8 ounces of warm water. You can do this a few times a day as needed. \n\nApple Cider Vinegar \n\nThere are a few different ways to use apple cider vinegar to soothe your sore throat. You can create an apple cider vinegar gargle by mixing 1 teaspoon of apple cider vinegar with ½ teaspoon of salt and 8 ounces of warm water. Another way to use apple cider vinegar is to mix it with honey and warm water. It can also be used in teas, with green tea or licorice root tea."

At the time, 41 people in Wuhan had been diagnosed with the novel coronavirus, so named for the crownlike spikes that help them invade cells, and Chinese officials said the threat of human-to-human transmission was low. A CDC notice advised Americans who’d been in Wuhan and felt sick to seek care.\n\nOn Jan. 17, the U.S. began checks of passengers from Wuhan at airports in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco.\n\nTwo days later, the recent arrival from Wuhan visited the urgent-care clinic in Snohomish County, Washington, and the intensive response began. In retrospect, it was already too late. Some researchers who’ve traced the viral genomes of patients around the world now believe someone else in the area picked it up between Jan. 15 and Jan. 19, before the traveler went to the hospital. He might have sneezed in the airport shuttle or on some surface—all but impossible for health workers to trace.\n\n“This virus is more contagious than the flu, so any sort of exposures before he got to the hospital would be certainly of high concern,” said George Diaz, who leads the infectious disease department at Providence, where the patient was treated."

The 35-year-old had seen a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention alert about the virus and decided to get checked. He put on a mask in the waiting room. After learning about his travel, the clinic drew blood and took nasal and throat swabs, and called state and county health officials, who hustled the sample onto an overnight flight to the CDC lab in Atlanta.

It’s horseshit,” added Gen. Michael Hayden, via Twitter. Hayden served as director of the CIA from 2006 to Feb. 12, 2009, shortly after Obama took office.\n\nBen Rhodes, former deputy national security adviser to Obama, added his voice on Twitter as well: “Trump is lying. I was there for all 8 years. Obama never sought a meeting with Kim Jong Un. Foreign policy isn’t reality television it’s reality.”\n\nRhodes told CNN that Obama “never even considered” seeking a meeting with Kim. “There’s no mystery here: It’s just a lie with no supporting evidence and no basis in anything. It’s not even an exaggeration, it’s just not true.”\n\nAnd on CNN’s “State of the Union,” James Clapper, who served as director of national intelligence for most of Obama’s presidency, said he was puzzled by Trump’s claim. “In all the deliberations that I have participated in on North Korea during the Obama administration, I can recall no instance whatever where President Obama ever indicated any interest whatsoever in meeting with the — Chairman Kim,” Clapper said.\n\nWe reached out to the Trump press office, but it did not provide any further information.\n\nIt’s true that during a debate in the run-up to the 2008 presidential election, Obama famously said that he would be willing to meet with leaders in North Korea and other enemy nations without any preconditions."

Hussen said the new targets will bring Canada's immigration to nearly one per cent of the population by 2020, which will help offset an aging demographic. He called it a historic and responsible plan and \"the most ambitious\" in recent history. \"Our government believes that newcomers play a vital role in our society,\" Hussen said. \"Five million Canadians are set to retire by 2035 and we have fewer people working to support seniors and retirees.\""

            "answer": "November 1, 2017 – Ottawa plans to welcome 980,000 new immigrants over the next three years under an ambitious three-year immigration plan announced by the federal government on Nov. 1. Annual immigration levels could rise to as high as 360,000 by 2020 under the multi-year plan. This would be first time in more than a century that our immigration rate is 1% of our population.\n\nImmigration Minister Ahmed Hussen described the announcement as ‘historic’, as the government outlines its plan for the next three years, featuring managed increases across all categories.\n\nIn 2018, the immigration target will rise to 310,000, from the current 300,000 set for 2017. This target could rise to as much as 330,000 under the latest announcement. In 2019, the target will be 330,000, with an upper limit of 350,000 new immigrants. In 2020, the target figure will be 340,000, and the upper limit 360,000.\n\nThe latest plan will drive up immigration numbers to historic levels as the government pushes the annual number of newcomers towards 1 per cent of Canada’s population a target first used by the Liberals in the early 1990’s. The current levels of 300,000 correspond into an immigration rate near .82 per cent."

Bubonic plague is the most common form and is characterized by painful swollen lymph nodes or 'buboes'.\nPlague is transmitted between animals and humans by the bite of infected fleas, direct contact with infected tissues, and inhalation of infected respiratory droplets.\nPlague can be a very severe disease in people, with a case-fatality ratio of 30% to 60% for the bubonic type, and is always fatal for the pneumonic kind when left untreated.\nAntibiotic treatment is effective against plague bacteria, so early diagnosis and early treatment can save lives.\nFrom 2010 to 2015 there were 3248 cases reported worldwide, including 584 deaths.\nCurrently, the three most endemic countries are the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar, and Peru.\nPlague is an infectious disease caused by the bacteria Yersinia pestis, a zoonotic bacteria, usually found in small mammals and their fleas. It is transmitted between animals through fleas. Humans can be infected through:\nthe bite of infected vector fleas\nunprotected contact with infectious bodily fluids or contaminated materials\nthe inhalation of respiratory droplets/small particles from a patient with pneumonic plague."

Several videos have surfaced which shows the Delhi Police did apprehend the man after they were made aware that he was carrying a weapon. While analyzing the video, at the 14th second, it can be seen that the police sneak up behind him and catches hold of him. The Police are being warned that the man is carrying a pistol. The video clearly shows that the man was seized as soon as he fired a shot. Further, police are mandated to follow standard protocols when dealing with an active shooter. In the face of a man holding a weapon at a crowded place like a university, it becomes all the more necessary to follow these protocols precisely. This would ensure that the situation doesn't get out of hand, and the shooter does not get agitated. Police officers responding to an active shooter are trained in a procedure known as Rapid Deployment and are supposed to proceed immediately to the area in which shots were last heard; their purpose is to stop the shooting as quickly as possible. The first responding officers will normally be in teams of four (4); they may be dressed in regular patrol uniforms, or they may be wearing external bulletproof vests, Kevlar helmets, and other tactical equipment. The officers may be armed with rifles, shotguns, or handguns, and might also be using pepper spray or tear gas to control the situation. There's nothing safe about a single officer running to confront a potential murderer or a terrorist"

Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face. \n\nThe COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so it’s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow)."

An outbreak of pneumonia of unknown etiology was identified through surveillance in Wuhan, however the possibility that the virus may have silently circulated elsewhere cannot be ruled out. For example, some countries have retrospectively identified cases of COVID-19 weeks before the first case was officially notified through surveillance, and unpublished reports of positive sewage samples could suggest that the virus may have circulated undetected for some time. The COVID-19 outbreak was first reported in Wuhan, where the SARS-CoV-2 virus was also first identified and characterized. The detection was followed by a rapid exponentially growing outbreak, weeks before other outbreaks were detected elsewhere. Thus, under the framework of global tracing for the origins of SARS-CoV-2, the approach to identifying the source of infection, the source of introduction and possible origins of the virus initially conducted in Wuhan is of importance for further global origin tracing work."

Considered in the 1980s to be one of the Democratic Party’s new ​“neoliberals,” Biden called then for a spending freeze on Social Security and a higher Social Security retirement age. In 1995, he cast his vote for a balanced budget constitutional amendment, despite his earlier criticisms of it. The choice was, he said, ​“an imperfect amendment or continued spending.” When he ran for president 12 years later, he again called for the Social Security retirement age to go up.\n\nIn journalist Bob Woodward’s 2012 book The Price of Politics, he portrays Biden during Obama’s first term eager to sacrifice Social Security and Medicare for the sake of bipartisan compromise and achieving what would be, in the eyes of Washington, a political victory.\n\nBiden first displayed his friendliness to GOP entitlement hawks when he appointed former Wyoming Sen. Alan Simpson to co-chair the president’s National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility, created in February 2010 via executive order. Simpson was one of Congress’s most high-profile foes of entitlements and a proponent of Social Security privatization. In Woodward’s telling, Biden even had to lightly pressure a somewhat reluctant Simpson to take the role.\n\nSure enough, the Simpson-Bowles Commission, as it came to be known, recommended cuts to Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, leading liberal economist Paul Krugman to label the commission ​“terrible.” Failing to secure enough votes from the commission to recommend the plan to Congress, the proposals were never taken up.\n\nBut Biden took a far more direct role in undermining Social Security and Medicare when he headed tax policy negotiations with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell in December 2010. In Woodward’s telling, Biden’s eagerness to cut a deal with the Republicans sometimes elicited outrage from his fellow Democrats, who felt he was giving too much away.\n\nAn Obama priority was to end the Bush tax cuts on t"

Crisis actors are used to create high-fidelity simulations of disasters in order to allow first responders to practice their skills and help emergency services to prepare and train in realistic scenarios as part of full-scale disaster exercises. \n\nConspiracy theories and defamation - In the United States, the term has been used by conspiracy theorists who claim that mass shootings and other disasters are staged, and victims and their families are being played by crisis actors in order to pass gun control laws. Conspiracy theorists' use of the term is thought to have originated in 2012, when a blog post by former professor and professional conspiracy theorist James Tracy suggested that the government could have hired an acting agency named Visionbox to help stage the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. Visionbox offered dramatic training \"in criminal and victim behavior\" to actors intended to help \"bring intense realism to simulated mass casualty incidents in public places\"."

In addition to the Iowa plant’s shutdown, the owners will also close the doors of a plant in Michigan.ould tread water for a little while, but I came to a point where I was underwater. I couldn’t make a profit at all. I was bleeding cash,” said Roy Strom, CEO of W2 Fuel to reporters at the Des Moines Register.\n\nThis is the third plant in Iowa alone to announce it will shut down following small refinery exemptions (SRE) to RFS. Similar announcements have been made in other states.\n\nEarlier this month, Siouxland Energy Cooperative in Sioux Center, Iowa announced it would idle production over SREs.\n\n“The administration’s actions unfairly benefit the oil industry at the expense of our local farmers and if not addressed soon, will impact the livelihoods of many,” said Kevin Neiuwenhuis, president of the board for the plant in a recent press release.\n\nIn early August the Trump administration granted 31 additional SRE waivers. Six additional waiver requests were either withdrawn or denied.\n\n“The vast majority of these exemptions are not justified under the law,” said Iowa Renewable Fuels Association (IRFA) Executive Director Monte Shaw in a press release. “Since this news began to leak this afternoon, RFS credit prices have freefallen to nearly zero, destroying much of the incentive to blend an incremental gallon of ethanol.”"

Charges typically fall into one of two categories: correctable offenses and willful violations.\n\nCorrectable Offenses\n\nSimply forgetting to carry your driver's license while driving a vehicle may lead to a \"fix-it ticket,\" where you must later show proof that you fixed the violation in order to have the citation dismissed by the traffic court. Failure to present this evidence typically leads to fines or other penalties.\n\nWillful Violations\n\nPenalties for willful violations of licensing requirements, such as driving on a suspended or revoked license, are much more serious. Driver's licenses are frequently suspended for DUI offenses, since states have an interest in keeping dangerous drivers off the roads. Therefore, when a driver willfully drives with a suspended or revoked driver's license, they may be cited, arrested, and charged with a misdemeanor offense."

It has turned a wealthy country with a rich history and culture into an economically depleted rogue state whose chief exports are violence, bloodshed, and chaos.  The longest-suffering victims of Iran’s leaders are, in fact, its own people. Rather than use its resources to improve Iranian lives, its oil profits go to fund Hezbollah and other terrorists that kill innocent Muslims and attack their peaceful Arab and Israeli neighbors.  This wealth, which rightly belongs to Iran’s people, also goes to shore up Bashar al-Assad’s dictatorship, fuel Yemen’s civil war, and undermine peace throughout the entire Middle East.We cannot let a murderous regime continue these destabilizing activities while building dangerous missiles, and we cannot abide by an agreement if it provides cover for the eventual construction of a nuclear program. The Iran Deal was one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into.  Frankly, that deal is an embarrassment to the United States, and I don’t think you’ve heard the last of it — believe me."

The comments seemed to hit home, triggering an emotional response from Trump on Twitter. “Iran leadership doesn’t understand the words ‘nice’ or ‘compassion,’ they never have. Sadly, the thing they do understand is Strength and Power, and the USA is by far the most powerful Military Force in the world, with 1.5 Trillion Dollars invested over the last two years alone,” he tweeted. “The U.S. has not forgotten Iran’s use of IED’s & EFP’s (bombs), which killed 2000 Americans, and wounded many more … Any attack by Iran on anything American will be met with great and overwhelming force. In some areas, overwhelming will mean obliteration.” The statements from Trump seem to contradict other US officials, who say the US wants to negotiate with Iran rather than escalate the dispute. “The United States is not looking to go to war with Iran,” said Mark T. Esper, the acting defense secretary. “Rather, we want to get to a diplomatic path.” Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, also insisted the president remained open to real negotiations and “all that Iran needs to do is walk through that open door.”"

Exemption arrangements are in place that cover many patients, including those aged under 16 or 60 and over, as well as recipients of specific state benefits. The exemptions in place resulted in 90 per cent of all prescription items in England being dispensed free of charge last year (Health and Social Care Information Centre 2016).\n\nThe relative contribution from each of these sources of finance – general taxation, National Insurance and user charges – has fluctuated over the years (see Commission on the Future of Health and Social Care in England 2014b). For example, the proportion of income from user charges, from a high of 5 per cent in 1960 remained at 1.2 per cent between 2007 and 2011 (Hawe and Cockcroft 2013)."

So, the final \"ACA\" (Obamacare) required lawmakers and staffers to get their insurance through the local health exchange, the District of Columbia’s small business health options program (SHOP) exchange.\n\nFor the 2017 plan year, there were 57 plan options in the gold tier on the DC SHOP. Members and staff have to choose at least the gold option to receive the employer contribution, which is figured at 72% of the weighted average of all FEHB plan premiums.  \n\nOnce a member or staffer is no longer in federal service, they have an option to enroll in an FEHB plan under Temporary Continuation of Coverage (TCC) that they pay for (like COBRA).\n\nWant more details on the Congressional health benefits? This CRS Report has you covered.\n\nCongressional retirement benefits\nUp until 1984, federal employees (including Members of Congress) did not pay Social Security taxes or receive Social Security benefits but were instead covered by the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS). Members elected after 1984 are covered by the Federal Employees’ Retirement System (FERS).\n\nLike other federal employees, Congressional pensions are financed through employee and employer contributions. Members pay Social Security payroll taxes equal to 6.2% Social Security taxes and contribute to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (CSRDF).\n\nMembers of Congress are eligible for a pension at age 62 (with at least five years of service), age 50 (with at least twenty years of service), or at any age (after 25 years of service). \"The amount of the pension depends on years of service and the average of the highest three years of\nsalary.

Taking into account the lack of significant growth in demand for natural gas in central \nEurope, according to Poland, that would, as its only possible consequence, influence the \nconditions of supply and use of transmission services on the pipelines competing with OPAL. The \nGeneral Court observes, in that regard, that that principle imposes not only obligations of mutual \nassistance where, for example following natural disasters or acts of terrorism, a Member State is in \na critical or emergency situation as regards its gas supply, but also requires the European Union \nand the Member States to endeavour, in the exercise of their powers in the field of energy policy,\nto avoid adopting measures likely to affect the interests of the EU and other Member States as \nregards security of supply, its economic and political viability, the diversification of supply or of \nsources of supply, and to do so in order to take account of their interdependence and de facto \nsolidarity."

The INA Section 274A provisions,sometimes referred to as employer sanctions, make it unlawful for an employer to knowinglyhire, recruit or refer for a fee, or continue to employ an alien who is not authorized to be soemployed. Today, ICE’s worksite enforcement program is focused primarily on cases that involvecritical infrastructure facilities and cases involving employers who commit “egregious” violationsof criminal statutes and engage in worker exploitation.Employers who violate INA prohibitions on the unlawful employment of aliens may be subject tocivil monetary penalties and/or criminal penalties.

To make this less likely, you will be given extra fluids through a tube in your arm (IV), and you may need to lie on your side. Sometimes, your anesthesiologist will give you a medication to maintain your blood pressure.\n    Sore back – Your lower back may be sore where the needle was inserted to deliver the medication. This soreness should last no more than a few days. There is no evidence that an epidural can cause permanent back pain.\n    Headache – On rare occasions, the needle pierces the covering of the spinal cord, which can cause a headache that may last for a few days if left untreated. If this situation arises, discuss the treatment options with your anesthesiologist."

This results in decreased sensation in the lower half of the body."

The pump feeds the epidural solution into the catheter continuously, providing pain relief for as long as needed.\n\nThe type, amount and strength of the anaesthetic can be adjusted, as necessary. You might also be given the option of having control of the medication pump. This is called patient controlled analgesia. The amount of painkiller is still regulated, so you can’t accidentally overdose.\n\nYou can have the dose lowered for second stage pushing, but it takes some time for the pain relief and numbness to wear off, so if this is important to you, discuss it with your care provider early on."

These prominent screenwriters and directors, who became known as the Hollywood Ten, received jail sentences and were banned from working for the major Hollywood studios. Their defiant stands also placed them at center stage in a national debate over the controversial anti-communist crackdown that swept through the United States in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Besides the Hollywood Ten, other members of the film industry with alleged communist ties were later banned from working for the big movie studios. The Hollywood blacklist came to an end in the 1960s."

However, it also seems that taking the Pill slightly increases your risk of cancer of the cervix – although this may be due to having sex without a condom, rather than the Pill. All women should have regular smear tests.\n\nIf you have breast cancer, or have had it in the past, you should not take the Pill. The Pill slightly increases your risk of breast cancer. This risk goes up the longer you’re on the Pill, but returns to normal within about 10 years of stopping it. Because breast cancer is rare in women under the age of 40, the extra cases of breast cancer in current and recent Pill users is small. For example:\n\n    Of 10,000 women who have never taken the Pill, about 16 will have breast cancer by the time they are 35 years old.\n    Of 10,000 women who take the Pill for 5 years in their early twenties, about 17–18 will have breast cancer by the time they are 35 years old.\n    Of 10,000 women who have never taken the Pill, about 100 will have breast cancer by the time they are 45 years old.\n    Of 10,000 women who take the Pill for 5 years in their early thirties, about 110 will have breast cancer by the time they are 45 years old.\n\nYour risk of breast cancer is higher:\n\n    if you have a close relative (mother, sister or grandmother) who has had breast cancer\n    if you are seriously overweight\n\n    See a doctor as soon as possible if you notice any changes in your breasts, such as dimpling of the skin, changes in the nipple or any lumps you can see or feel.\n\nTaking the Pill has also been linked to liver diseases, such as jaundice and non-cancer liver tumours, but this is rare. Very rarely, the Pill has also been linked with some forms of liver cancer in women who have taken it for a long time."

            "answer": "The combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP), often referred to as the birth control pill or colloquially as \"the pill\", is a type of birth control that is designed to be taken orally by women. It includes a combination of an estrogen (usually ethinylestradiol) and a progestogen (specifically a progestin). When taken correctly, it alters the menstrual cycle to eliminate ovulation and prevent pregnancy.\n\nThey were first approved for contraceptive use in the United States in 1960, and are a very popular form of birth control. They are used by more than 100 million women worldwide and by almost 12 million females in the United States.[9] From 2015 to 2017, 12.6% of women aged 15–49 in the US reported using oral contraception, making it the second most common method of contraception in this age range with female sterilization being the most common method.[10] Use varies widely by country,[11] age, education, and marital status. For example, one third of women aged 16–49 in the United Kingdom currently use either the combined pill or progestogen-only pill (POP),[12][13] compared with less than 3% of women in Japan (as of 1950–2014).[14]\n\nCombined oral contraceptives are on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.[15] The pill was a catalyst for the sexual revolution.[16]"

If fertilization does occur, Plan B may prevent a fertilized egg from attaching to the womb (implantation).\" In short, despite the confusion that opponents have fostered surrounding emergency contraception's mode of action, how the method works depends more on when during a woman's monthly menstrual cycle it is taken (and, specifically, whether she has ovulated) than on when she had sexual intercourse."

It would also give Floridians who already own these weapons a year to register them before their possession becomes illegal."

A full one-third of global homicides occur in Latin America even though the region has just 8% of the world's population, according to United Nations data.\n\nDrug trafficking, gang wars, political instability, corruption, and poverty combine to cause the region's elevated violence.\n\nUS cities also made the list, led by Detroit at No. 24 and New Orleans at No. 26."

            "answer": "In March, every member of the U.S. women's team filed a lawsuit against the soccer federation for gender discrimination. It stipulates that currently, if each team played and won 20 exhibition games in a year, “female WNT players would earn a maximum of $99,000 or $4,950 per game, while similarly situated male MNT players would earn an average of $263,320 or $13,166 per game.\" So the team is seeking equal treatment and pay, because as it stands, the women reportedly 38% of what their male counterparts make. As far as individual players' incomes, they can vary markedly based on sponsorships and star power. Goalie Ashlyn Harris told The New York Times that she expects to make “between $300,000 and $400,000” this year, and another player estimated $167,500. Alex Morgan is estimated to earn $1 million annually. But for players without endorsement deals and less celebrity status, the numbers can be a lot lower.Prior to the U.S. team's most recent landslide victory, Democratic presidential candidates Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, and Elizabeth Warren have long taken up the cause of equal pay in sports. The Paycheck Fairness Act, passed by House Democrats, would protect against gender discrimination, though it is currently stalled in the Senate. Notably, when asked by a reporter earlier this week if the women's team should be paid the same as the men, President Trump declined to respond."

        "question": "How much is Women's World Cup 2019 Prize Money ?",
        "answers": [
          {
            "answer": "The 2019 World Cup championship team will win $4 million, and the total prize money awarded to all teams during this summer's World Cup is roughly $30 million. Both figures are double what the women's World Cup paid out to teams during the 2015 tournament in Canada. But let's compare those figures with the men's World Cup: In 2018, World Cup champion France was awarded $38 million by FIFA for winning the tournament, which is more than what all of the 2019 women's World Cup teams get combined. The prize money overall for the men's 2018 World Cup in Russia came to a total of $400 million, or over 13 times more than the FIFA prize money for the women this summer. What's more, members of the USA women's team earned bonuses of $90,000 for reaching the quarterfinals in the 2019 World Cup. If the U.S. men's team had reached the same point in last year's World Cup, they would have gotten bonuses of $550,000. This is the case even though the U.S. women's team outearns the men's team in revenues. The main argument for why the men's World Cup prize money totals are so much bigger than the women's counterpart is that men's soccer has far more interest among fans — and far higher revenues overall around the globe. The women's World Cup 2015 in Canada reportedly brought in $73 million in revenues, including some $17 million in TV ads just in the U.S. Those are actually tiny numbers compared to the $6 billion in revenues FIFA raked in during the 2018 men's World Cup in Russia."

        "answers": [
          {
            "answer": "The U.S. women's national team fought for a raise, and got one in 2017, when players began receiving an undisclosed pay increase. Before then, members of the U.S. national team were paid \"a maximum of $4,950 per 'friendly,' or non-tournament, game that they won, while men’s national-team players earned an average of $13,166 for the same thing,\" according to The Atlantic. Yet even after the pay raise, America's female national team still makes significantly less than their male equivalents. This is the case even though the women have won three World Cups and four Olympic gold medals over the past two decades, compared to zero and zero for the U.S. men's team. Earlier this year, the U.S. women's team filed a lawsuit against U.S. Soccer, seeking better pay for women, who reportedly earn 38% of what their male counterparts make. Among other arguments U.S. Soccer attorneys have made to explain the gender pay differences are that the men's and women's national teams \"have separate collective bargaining agreements; and have separate budgets that take into account the different revenue that the teams generate.\" While U.S. Soccer fights the women's national team lawsuit, sponsors have stepped up in the battle over equal pay. In early April, USWNT sponsor LUNA Bar made a donation that will give each member of the women's team $31,250 — which is the difference between the World Cup bonuses for America's men's and women's teams. Meanwhile, U.S. Soccer sponsor Visa says that under the terms of a new five-year deal more than 50% of its funding will go to the women's team, rather than a 50-50 split between men and women like in the past. And soccer branding titan Adidas says that it will pay equal bonuses to all of its sponsored players, male and female alike, for winning the World Cup. So how much money could U.S. women's national team players make if they win the World Cup 2019? It's difficult"

            "answer": "Sometimes. When the female players have appeared to make about the same or more money, they’ve had to turn in consistently outstanding performances on the world stage. Even with those feats, earning the same amount as the men’s soccer players was near-impossible under the previous collective-bargaining agreement.\n\nThe new agreement has provisions that may reduce the difference in bonuses for friendly games and tournaments, but there is — without question and for whatever reasons — still a massive gap between men’s and women’s World Cup bonuses. Hence, since it is true that the women soccer players are paid less as they bring lesser revenue."

The Purdue Pharma case shows how the Justice Department contributed to this catastrophe by failing to hold drug company executives accountable to the same level of justice as street-level drug dealers."

            "answer": "After the Rose Revolution brought Saakashvili to power in 2004, Moscow soon began applying energy sanctions to the recalcitrant Georgian leader. As with other defiant ex-Soviet states, Georgia was subjected to massive gas price increases. From 2004 to 2006 the price demanded by Gazprom, the Russian state gas monopoly, increased by nearly 500 percent, from $50 to $235 per thousand cubic meters.19 Moscow tried to portray this as a ‘normal’ price increase, designed to bring Georgia in line with prices charged to Moscow's West European purchasers, which the Kremlin described as the “world market price.” Yet the political rationale was clear. First, price increases were targeted carefully to states which angered Moscow. Georgia, in fact, was treated the worst of any state—it was the first to be forced to pay full ‘Western’ prices, even ahead of Ukraine. Russia's most dramatic action, though, took place on January 22, 2006. Just days earlier it had stopped gas supplies to the Ukraine, allegedly over a pricing dispute. But it seemed that simply turning off the gas valves, even in midwinter, was not enough of a punishment for Georgia. Russia announced that both main gas lines to Georgia had been cut by bomb blasts, allegedly the work of Chechen separatists.23 Doubts were quickly raised. Why would Chechens target Georgia, a state which was at worst neutral in their dispute with Russia—and perhaps covertly a supporter, as Moscow alleged? Although it was never proven, many believed that Moscow had cut the lines deliberately, to weaken Saakashvili's government. Georgia suffered through a few days of closed schools and factories and freezing homes until gas service was restored.24"

            "answer": "As tensions rose with the new Saakashvili government, that is exactly what Moscow did. Georgian shipments were delayed by long ‘customs inspections’—a fatal measure for goods such as fresh fruit. The quality and safety of Georgian wine and mineral water was questioned. Russia's Chief Sanitary Inspector, Gennady Onishchenko, claimed that Georgian wine contained heavy metals and pesticides.33 In March, 2006, sales of Georgian wine were forbidden on ‘health’ grounds—a measure which remained in effect for over seven years—until, as we shall see, the election of a new President suddenly made Georgian wine ‘healthy’ again. Similarly, two major brands of Georgian mineral water were barred from the Russian marked in May, 2006 for “failing to meet water purity standards.”34 Banning imports on ‘health’ grounds has become a favorite tactic of the Kremlin, since these actions seem superficially plausible compared to open embargos.35"

Flores, the 1993 Supreme Court case that has returned to the spotlight with the surge in family separations. The case led to an agreement requiring the government to release children to their parents, a relative or a licensed program within 20 days.\n\nIn the ruling, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote “it is well established that the Fifth Amendment entitles aliens to due process of law in deportation proceedings.”\n\nHow it works in practice: Immigrants have the right to due process. But in reality, says, Andrew Arthur, a resident fellow in law and policy at the conservative Center for Immigration Studies, “courts of law run the gamut.”\n\nIn some cases, immigrants are not granted a hearing at all. When asked about the president’s tweet, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders pointed to the process of “expedited removal,” which was created by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996.\n\n“Just because you don’t see a judge doesn’t mean you aren’t receiving due process,” Sanders said.\n\nUnder the expedited removal process, immigrants who have been in the country illegally for less than two years and are apprehended within 100 miles of the border can be deported almost immediately without going through a court hearing.\n\nThe exception is asylum seekers, who must be granted a hearing.\n\nThose who are not processed through expedited removal have the right to due process in an immigration court, where the main goal is to decide whether a person has a legal claim to remain in the U.S.\n\n“In immigration court, you have very few rights,” said John Gihon, an immigration attorney who spent six years as a prosecutor for U.S. Immigration and Cust"

Shokin’s claims are highly questionable. The illegal enrichment and money laundering investigation against Zlochevsky was started in August 2014 at the request of Shokin’s deputy, Vitaly Kasko. He had a strained relationship with his boss, and resigned in early 2016, two months before Shokin’s firing. Shokin didn’t actually lead the Zlochevsky investigation, so his removal wasn’t necessary to stop it. Besides, Kasko denies there was any U.S. pressure to end the investigation: He told Bloomberg News that the case had been dormant for a while when Shokin was fired."

During the trip, Vice President Biden warned Chinese leaders not to use fighter jets to enforce an air defense zone created by Beijing over contested waters.\n\nThe conservative author Peter Schweizer has suggested that Hunter Biden used the trip to secure a deal with the Bank of China — a suggestion that has been echoed by Mr. Trump’s allies in the conservative news media."

President Trump is complacent and self-congratulatory. However, the 10% tariff increase from the previous round seems to have been paid by American companies and consumers! US importers must see their profits eroded by tariffs if they do not directly pass these costs onto US companies downstream. A study by a group of economists from Princeton, Columbia, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York estimates that US companies have suffered a loss of $1.4 billion due to tariffs, while American consumers have footed the bill for more than $3 billion. Another study by another group of economists from the World Bank and the International Finance Corporation argues that the US-China trade war has cost the American economy $6.4 billion, equivalent to 0.03% of GDP. It seems unwise to let American companies and consumers take such large losses for such little increase in fiscal revenue."

The cartridge was pressurized with nitrogen so that it didn't rely on gravity to make it work. It was dependable in freezing cold and desert heat. It could also write underwater and upside down. The trick was to have the ink flow when you wanted it to, and not to flow the rest of the time, a problem Fisher solved. Fisher's development couldn't have come at a more opportune time. The space race was on, and the astronauts involved in the Mercury and Gemini missions had been using pencils to take notes in space since standard ball points did not work in zero gravity. The Fisher cartridge did work in the weightlessness of outer space and the astronauts, beginning with the October, 1968 Apollo 7 mission began using the Fisher AG-7 Space Pen and cartridge developed in 1966."

During a press conference, Aaron Hull, Chief Patrol Agent of the U.S. Border Patrol in El Paso sector, mostly referred to the project as the wall, sometimes calling it \"fence\" but quickly correcting himself. Hull said the metal barrier was the same design as others from the 2006 Secure Fence Act. The new barrier replaced existing metal posts which were designed only to block vehicles. \nIn September, the Border Patrol announced construction of \"a new 4-mile section of bollard wall\" in the historic Chihuahuita neighborhood in El Paso. The new bollards replaced existing chain-link fencing.\nIn October, border officials marked the completion of 2 miles of barriers near Calexico, Calif. Crews had replaced older metal fencing with new, 30-foot steel bollards, a project identified as a priority and funded under President Barack Obama.\nIn November, Customs and Border Protection officials announced a contract for about 6 miles of \"wall system\" in the Rio Grande Valley. The project is supposed to include a concrete levee wall \"to the height of the existing levee\" with 18-foot bollards on top. That barrier is not being built yet; it's set to be started in February.\nNone of those barriers look like the wall prototypes built near San Diego, which Trump visited and praised earlier this year."

Even growing flowers at home to feed bees contributes to this effort,\" Graziano da Silva said.\n\nPollinators, such as bees, wild bees, birds, bats, butterflies and beetles fly, hop and crawl over flowers to help plants fertilize. Pollinator numbers and diversity have declined in the past decades, and evidence indicates that the decline is primarily a consequence of human activities including climate change which can disrupt flowering seasons."

It’s also not completely free. There are still direct costs such as for uniforms, transport and food. And the opportunity cost – the loss of possible income and domestic labour provided by children – is not considered.\n\nProviding free tuition without also giving legislative and other support to parents in different social contexts would not guarantee a 100% transition rate,"

It is even not uncommon to find a group of friends fixing Dubai as the destination of their next social gathering.\n\nOur politicians also have choice properties in this Arab state, but with the new immigration policy, only people who are 40 years and above can visit the UAE now, although the authorities gave certain conditions for people who are less than 40 years old who want to visit.\n\nWhen I first heard of this new policy, I knew Nigerians have ‘spoilt’ this Arab country as well.\nIn 1988, I was travelling to India and had a stop-over in Dubai; the place was nothing to write home at that time, but now, less than 30 years later, Nigerians of all ages troop to Dubai for different purposes. It is just so unfortunate that while we have regressed, they have progressed.\n\nWhy have our leaders chosen to enrich themselves only at the expense of the people?; Why have we failed to develop? Where are all the money we have made selling oil, and yet cannot boast more than $30billion in foreign reserves?\n\nWe will continue to be treated with disdain in other parts of the world if we don’t develop our country.\nOther countries will never respect us if we cant live in our country, and instead prefer to travel for greener pastures outside.\nIt is so painful today seeing Nigerians in even less-developed countries ekeing out a living.\nI hope we can wake up on time before we experience more foreign insults.\n\nDr Tajudeen Alalade,\nIlorin, Kwara state"

Staring down anticipated premium hikes of up to 25 percent on the public health insurance exchanges, millions of concerned citizens voted for the candidate they felt was most likely to make positive changes to a system that has never quite managed to address their needs.\n\nThe impact of a Republican Congressional majority, a Republican President, and a vacant seat on a Supreme Court that already struck down one of the ACA’s major provisions is as of yet unknown, but a conservative twist to our national drama will certainly bring the future of the healthcare coverage framework into question.\n\nFor healthcare provider organizations, the plot will thicken even further.  Thanks to provisions that require payers to cover patients with preexisting conditions and adhere to premium caps that have reduced their profitability, the ACA has incentivized a quick shift towards value-based care. \n\nEager to trim costs, pay for fewer services, and attract as many patients as possible in a competitive and confusing marketplace, payers have incentivized providers to abandon the traditional fee-for-service reimbursement structure and look to population health management strategies as a way to stem the financial bleeding.\n\nWill significant changes to the Affordable Care Act free up payers to return to more lucrative business practices, or will commercial insurers, Medicare, and Medicaid stay the course?\n\nHow can healthcare providers position themselves for success in what will undoubtedly be another turbulent episode in the healthcare saga, and what are the nation’s options for developing a new path forward while still delivering the best possible care"

The ICJ’s interlocutors also stressed the fact that as judges are aware of the expectations of a particular outcome in a case over which they preside regardless of the evidence, there is often no need to give direct instructions. Furthermore when such expectations are not met, a judicial decision may be overturned or not implemented and the judge may face discipline as a result of having issued an “erroneous” decision. Two types of cases, in which “telephone justice” is particularly prevalent, were singled out: criminal cases for conduct considered to be terrorism-related and cases related to the exercise of the rights to freedom of expression or peaceful assembly.[15]"

The link, of course, merely leads to BBC’s India home page. This is the latest in a long string of fake news that has plagued the build-up to the elections.\n\nElectoral dirty tricks and propaganda have always been a part of politics. Stalin infamously urged writers to become “engineers of human souls\". What is new is the ease and scale with which technology can compromise our political process. The role social media, with its dopamine highs, played in Brexit and the 2016 US presidential election are the standout examples, but it goes beyond that. The US military has been experimenting with “computational propaganda\" in Cuba and the Middle East. The Russians are developing software for information warfare. Then there are drug cartels in Mexico suppressing Twitter debates. Regimes are busy building digital dictatorships—from China’s Citizen Score initiative to Singapore’s “data controlled society\".\n\nThis is the evolution of espionage 2.0 with the entire electoral process at risk. Election machinery could be attacked. Data could be stolen, information leaked and systems brought to a standstill. There could be hacks into databases, and cyber attacks on election war rooms and critical Election Commission (EC) infrastructure. This is not fearmongering. To give just two examples, Andrés Sepúlveda is currently serving a prison term in Colombia for manipulating Latin American elections over the past decade. And, in May 2015, Germany discovered a breach of 14 servers in the lower house of its parliament, originating from Russia.\n\nIndia is not immune to these threats.

Practices in the Eastern and Orthodox Churches have varied. Protestant denominations also show a wide diversity in this matter. The 1917 Code of Canon Law in  the Catholic Church mandated that women wear a veil or head covering. Prior to 1917 there was no universal Law but it was customary in most places for women to wear some sort of head covering. The 1983 Code of Canon Law made no mention of this requirement and by the 1980s most women, at least here in America, had ceased to wear veils or hats anyway. Currently there is no binding rule and the custom in most places is no head covering at all.\n\nScripture – In Biblical Times women generally wore veils in any public setting and this would include the Synagogue. The clearest New Testament reference to women veiling or covering their head is from St. Paul:"

Too often I find that the statements made by biblical expositors on this subject are inaccurate and simplistic. The more research I have done on the subject, the more I have come to see how problematic is the widely-accepted interpretation of 1 Corinthians 11:2-16 which asserts that Paul is merely urging the saints in Corinth to conform to local and secular customs. In my opinion this idea raises more problems than it solves.\n\nI conclude that Paul's explanations pertain to an established Christian custom, which may or may not have corresponded to any Jewish, Greek, or Roman custom of the time. Most \"cultural background\" treatments of this subject have failed to recognize the importance of the fact that in the first century the Church was itself a sub-culture, having its own traditions and customs.\n\nThis survey was prepared as a supporting document for my exegetical commentary on 1 Corinthians 11:2-16, to which I refer the reader for more specific comments on Paul's explanation of the early Christian custom.n ancient times men did not wear trousers, and women did not wear skirts. There were no shirts or blouses such as we wear today, either. Both sexes usually wore flowing garments comparable to the modern woman's dress. (1) In the Greek language the basic article of clothing was called the chiton (χιτών), and in the Latin language it was called the tunica. (2) In general, women wore a long chiton that reached all the way to the ankles. Over the chiton another garment, called the himation (ἱμάτιον), was worn (see figure 1). In the Latin language this was called the palla (for women) or the pallium (for men). The toga was a garment like the pallium, more V"

However real-world social networks (like Twitter) have some users who have hundreds of thousands of connections (followers)  and these users tend to tip the scale in favor of certain memes causing them to become viral."

            "answer": "Congress established the diversity visa program through the Immigration Act of 1990 in an effort to promote immigration from countries underrepresented in the United States. The number of diversity visas is limited by law to 55,000 per fiscal year, but the annual cap has been reduced to 50,000 since fiscal year 2000. While Congress called this cap a “temporary reduction,” it does not have an expiration date. As of 2017, the U.S. government states that this reduction will remain in effect as long as needed, including for 2019.\n\nThe diversity visa program makes up to 50,000 visas available each year to natives of eligible countries. The program is well known as the \"diversity lottery,\" since potential visa recipients are randomly selected from the pool of qualified entries. Yet, being randomly selected—or \"winning\" the lottery—does not guarantee admission to the United States but rather provides the individual an opportunity to apply for the Diversity Visa. The odds of being selected for this opportunity are very small, with an average of 13.3 million people submitting applications each year."

            "answer": "Only nationals of low-admission countries—defined as any country with fewer than 50,000 natives admitted to the United States in the previous five years—are eligible to enter the diversity lottery. Natives of countries that traditionally send large numbers of immigrants to the United States, such as Mexico, India, and China, are generally not eligible.\n\nEligible countries are grouped into six geographic regions: Europe; Africa; Asia; Oceania; North America (excluding Mexico); and South America, Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) calculates each region’s annual diversity visa allotment using a specific formula and recent immigration statistics. The allocation formula, which is recalculated every year, gives fewer visas to “high-admission” regions, or any region that accounted for more than a sixth of all immigrant admissions to the United States in the previous five years.   Additionally, no more than 7 percent of the year's available visas may go to natives of any one country.\n\nTo be eligible for a diversity visa, applicants must be admissible to the United States under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and have either a high-school education (or its equivalent) or at least two years of recent qualifying work experience. The applicant or the applicant’s spouse must be a native of one of the countries that qualify for the diversity visa program.\n\nThe diversity visa program only accepts applications submitted electronically within a short timeframe designated each year. Eligible applicants are limited to one entry per registration period and will be disqualified for submitting multiple entries."

These requirements and security procedures also apply for any family members (spouses and minor children) whom the lottery winner petitions to bring to the United States as derivatives.\n\nAn individual may be issued a visa and admitted into the United States only after passing all electronic and in-person screenings. If visa processing for a lottery winner or an eligible family member is not completed before the end of the fiscal year, the U.S. government will deny the application, and the person loses the opportunity to immigrate to the United States through that year's diversity visa program. While the individual may be eligible to enter the diversity lottery in future years, the chances of again being randomly selected to apply for the visa are slim."

Dental and vision care are part of the package, too. The details on long-term care might vary between the Senate and House versions, but broadly speaking, nursing home and related care grow under both proposals.\n\nThe government would set payment rates for services, drugs and medical equipment. Each year, the secretary of Health and Human Services would determine a national budget for all covered services and spending would be limited by that cap. For individuals, there would be no costs — no deductibles, no copays or coinsurance. The two exceptions would be for some prescription drugs — though that would be limited to $200 a year — and possibly for long-term care.\n\nIt would replace all other insurance, with limited exceptions, such as cosmetic surgery.

            "answer": "• Chapter 7 - This is the basic theory of bankruptcy under which a debtor gathers their assets, liquidates them, pays as many bills as possible, and then the unpaid bills go unpaid. \"In this case, the debtor is hoping to hold onto a few dollars so that (he) can keep on going with (his) own life and re-establish some economic foundation for (himself),\" Saxowsky says.\n\nIndividual debtors discharge as much debt as possible, but keep as much exempt property as possible for a \"fresh start.\" A corporation has no exemptions.\n\n• Chapter 11 - The debtor wants to reorganize and hold onto their business. This is typically used for corporations and individuals whose debt limits are too high to qualify for Chapter 13, a class for wage-earners, Minch says. There are no debt limits in Chapter 11.\n\nSaxowsky says the debtor may have to repay debts over a longer period of time than in the original loan agreement. Debtors continue to run the business as a debtor-in-possession, unless the court finds that assets are improperly managed or that the debtor in possession is violating court orders. Then a trustee is appointed.\n\n• Chapter 12 - This is a special chapter created by Congress in 1985, during the last farm credit crisis. It is especially for smaller \"family farms\" and \"family fisherman\" to avoid liquidation and foreclosure. It was created as a temporary measure and made permanent in 2005.\n\nRoger Minch, a Fargo lawyer who works in business law, says a Chapter 12 is the way to go for farmers in need of debt reorganization, but it's only possible if the farm is within limits."

Acute dermal exposure may cause irritation of the skin, blistering, or burns in\nhumans.  Contact with the eyes may cause permanent corneal opacification. Burns of the mouth and\nstomach may occur in humans following acute exposure via ingestion. (1,2)\nAcute oral exposure has been observed to result in muscular spasms, respiratory difficulty, and convulsions\nat high levels in rats.  In rats acutely exposed intravenously, liver and kidney tubular damage has been\nreported. (1,3)\nAcute animal exposure tests in rats have demonstrated beta-propiolactone to have extreme acute toxicity\nby inhalation. (4)\n\nChronic Effects (Noncancer):\nNo information is available on the chronic health effects of beta-propiolactone in humans.\nChronic dermal exposure has resulted in skin irritation, scarring, and hair loss in mice. (1,3)\nEPA has not established a Reference Concentration (RfC) or a Reference Dose (RfD) for betapropiolactone.(2)\n\nReproductive/Developmental Effects:\nNo information is available on the reproductive or developmental effects of beta-propiolactone in humans\nor animals.\n\nCancer Risk:\nNo information is available on the carcinogenic effects of beta-propiolactone in humans.\nSquamous cell carcinomas of the forestomach have been reported in orally exposed rats. (1,6,8)\nIn several studies of rats and mice exposed to beta-propiolactone via subcutaneous injection, local tumors\nhave been observed at the site of injection.  Lymphomas and hepatomas have been reported in mice\nfollowing intraperitoneal injection. (1,6,8)\nIn mice, hamsters, and guinea pigs dermally exposed, skin tumors have been observed. (1,6,8)\nEPA has not classified beta-propiolactone for carcinogenicity. (2)\nIARC has classified beta-propiolactone as a Group 2B, possible human carcinogen. (6)"

As of the third quarter of 2016, the most recent data available, the debt as Obama is set to leave office stood at $19,573,445,000,000.\n\nBased on the website USdebtclock.com, which extrapolates the US national debt in real time based on committed government spending, the debt will be roughly $19.97 trillion when President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Friday.\n\nThus, the national debt under Obama will have grown by about $9 trillion, or an increase of 86%.\n\nSome of this debt is attributable to bills passed by Obama's predecessor, George W. Bush, since the federal government's fiscal year budget operate differently from the calendar year. Also, both Bush and Obama rolled out large investment bills to help the US recover from the depths of the financial crisis."

          {
            "answer": "Have a good look at your diet – it’s very important if you want more energy in your daily life. Suggestions include:\n\n    Drink plenty of water – sometimes you feel tired simply because you’re mildly dehydrated. A glass of water will help do the trick, especially after exercise.\n    Be careful with caffeine – anyone feeling tired should cut out caffeine. The best way to do this is to gradually stop having all caffeine drinks (that includes coffee, tea and cola drinks) over a three-week period. Try to stay off caffeine completely for a month to see if you feel less tired without it.\n    Eat breakfast – food boosts your metabolism and gives the body energy to burn. The brain relies on glucose for fuel, so choose carbohydrate-rich breakfast foods such as cereals or wholegrain bread.\n    Don’t skip meals – going without food for too long allows blood sugar levels to dip. Try to eat regularly to maintain your energy levels throughout the day.\n    Eat a healthy diet – increase the amount of fruit, vegetables, wholegrain foods, low fat dairy products and lean meats in your diet. Reduce the amount of high fat, high sugar and high salt foods.\n    Don’t overeat – large meals can drain your energy. Instead of eating three big meals per day, try eating six mini-meals to spread your kilojoule intake more evenly. This will result in more constant blood sugar and insulin levels. You’ll also find it easier to lose excess body fat if you eat this way.\n    Eat iron rich foods – women, in particular, are prone to iron-deficiency (anaemia), which can lead to feeling fatigued. Make sure your diet includes iron-rich foods such as lean red meat."

ISIS can no longer claim it has a territorial caliphate in Iraq and Syria. It no longer controls land or operates a government.\n\nThat, however, doesn’t mean it could not resurge, as the president’s aides have made clear. In comparison with the last time the United States withdrew forces, the situation is eerily similar if not arguably worse."

This ingredient immediately acts on the pimple and gives you fast results and sounds very promising. But, this hack also comes with a lot of skin irritation. The paste is made for teeth, which means the concentration is higher and harsher, hence the itching and the burning sensation is caused.\n\nDryness\n\nWhen it comes to those big hideous pimples, toothpaste can immediately decrease the size. You may banish the pimple size, but this will also make your skin extremely dry. If you have acne-prone skin, then you can even witness more zits with the skin irritation and dryness.\n\nScars\n\nAt worst situations, applying the paste on acne can also lead to scars. For those angry red zits, toothpaste will cause a lot of burning sensation, which will eventually dry out the pimple. But with such harsh reaction, sometimes you can also be left with an ugly acne scar."

Most of the other 85 per cent are coated in shellac which is made from the lac beetle. It is not made from the beetle itself but a secretion produced by the female lac beetle to protect her eggs. Another little thing vegans need to look out for. You'll find similar glazing agents on shiny confectionary.

We advocate further mechanistic studies using appropriately registered therapeutic manuka honey, in particular studies that use non-reductionist systems biology approaches, along with detailed chemical and microbiological analyses to elucidate how honey acts at the molecular, cellular and population level, how this can differ in different strains and species of microbial pathogens, and how the host cell responds"

The higher the concentration of the compound used, the more cells died.\n\nThe researchers then reported their results and went into in-depth analysis about the biochemical changes occurring in these cells.\n\nThe researchers concluded that garlic compounds cause human glioblastoma cells to die by apoptosis.

Six of the trays were placed in each of 2 rooms which were both kept at the same temperature.After 12 days,The cress seeds in the first room were growing well,the seeds that were placed next to the router showed no real growth at all. The scientist observed that The problem is that due to a difference in temperature of just a few degrees, it can already take a couple of days for the cress to grow to the same height.If there was indeed a difference in temperature due to the placement of the laptops, it would be likely that the WiFi group could have germinated and grown similar to the control group if it was allowed to grow on for a couple of days.Norwegian science journalist said We have published around 60 years of research in at least 1,300 peer-reviewed studies that are essentially unable to find any effect on EM radiation cells in the frequency range in question. Nothing. The World Health Organization (WHO) went through 25,000 articles on the topic published over the last 30 years without finding any evidence that such radiation can have a biological effect."

PCNs are used for some moving traffic offences too, particularly in London – bus lanes, no entry, restricted turn, yellow box junction.\nYou may get a PCN by post, by hand or applied to your car windscreen.\nYou’ve got 28 days to pay or challenge.\nA PCN can be up to £70 outside London, and up to £130 in London.\nThe penalty is usually halved if paid within 14 days.\nAn unpaid PCN penalty is treated as a civil debt and you could be pursued through the county court system or even get a visit from the bailiff if the debt remains unpaid. Some local authorities don’t have civil parking enforcement powers and in these areas parking is enforced by the police or police-employed traffic wardens who will issue a Fixed Penalty Notice (FPN) enforced through the criminal justice system."

Other nutrients or bioactive constituents in dairy products, such as lactoferrin, vitamin D (from fortified dairy products) or the short-chain fatty acid butyrate may also impart some protective functions against colorectal cancer, but these require much better elucidation.\n\nThe CUP Panel concluded that the evidence was generally consistent for dairy products, milk, cheese and dietary calcium, and showed a decreased risk of colorectal cancer with higher consumption."

During the evening, a duty officer had to do the rounds of his unit's position, checking that the sentry posts were manned, rounding up the off-duty soldiers and packing them off to their beds or billets. He would be accompanied by one or more musicians. The ‘first post' was sounded when the duty officer started his rounds and, as the party proceeded from post to post, a drum was played. The drum beats told off-duty soldiers it was time to rest. If the soldiers were staying in a town, the beats told them it was time to quit the pubs."

The virus enters the body through the lining of the vagina, vulva, penis, rectum, or abraded or irritated tissues in the lining of the mouth through sexual activity.\n\nBlood contamination. HIV may also be spread through contact with infected blood. However, due to the screening of donated blood for evidence of HIV infection, the risk of acquiring HIV from blood transfusions is extremely low.\n\nNeedles. HIV is frequently spread by sharing needles, syringes, or drug use equipment with someone who is infected with the virus. Transmission from patient to health care worker, or vice-versa, through accidental sticks with contaminated needles or other medical instruments, is rare.\n\nNo known cases of HIV/AIDS have been spread by the following:\n\nSaliva\n\nSweat\n\nTears\n\nCasual contact, such as sharing food utensils, towels, and bedding\n\nSwimming pools\n\nTelephones\n\nToilet seats\n\nBiting insects (such as mosquitoes)"

It’s sort of like saying that you are going to be confused with a criminal because you wear a commonly sold red bracelet that was also found on the criminal. It’s not realistic.

The researchers, who included Sarkis, trained 8 dogs to detect COVID-19 in 198 sweat samples, around half of which were from people with the disease. When these were hidden in a row of negative samples, the dogs identified the positive samples 83–100% of the time. The paper does not say how well the dogs identified negative test results. The research is now under review at a journal, but Grandjean says the process has not been easy. “To publish papers on detection dogs is very difficult because most reviewers do not know anything about working dogs,” he says.\n\nThe data in that study look promising, says Fyodor Urnov, a gene-editing scientist who is working on COVID testing at the University of California, Berkeley. But he would like to see larger data sets on how well dogs identify positive and negative samples. He also notes that there is variation in how well individual dogs perform. In Grandjean’s study, for example, 2 dogs identified 68 out of 68 positive samples, whereas one missed 10 out of 57 cases."

AC lowers your fuel efficiency because it is diverting energy from the engine to power the car. The fuel to power the AC has to come from somewhere, and the engine is the most efficient way for the AC to get its energy.\n\nIf you’re driving at high speeds, leaving your windows down can actually lower your fuel efficiency more than using your AC would. Lowering your windows can lower your fuel efficiency because the wind entering your car creates a drag that forces your car to work harder to get to the same speed if the windows were rolled up."
